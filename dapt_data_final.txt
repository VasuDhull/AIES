(CSECON) Program
1. Preamble
Information technology and software technologies have greatly facilitated and changed the way
markets function. For engineers to become entrepreneurs and product creators, they must
understand the markets. Similarly, for a lot of problems that are of interest to the computer
science community, economic reasoning is crucial. Economics provides immense potential for
tangibly yielding socially-relevant research at IIITD, which is the institute's core vision for
long-term growth.
The B. Tech. program in Computer Science and Economics at IIIT-Delhi aims to provide
rigorous training in economics and computation that would prepare students for a professional
career in industry, including banking, finance, consulting, software technology and IT services,
as well as providing a thorough grounding for graduate level studies in both computer science
and economics. The program has a set of core courses in both Computer Science, Economics and
Mathematics, and a multitude of electives from both streams. The quantitative and computational
orientation of this program enables an interface between IT and economics, both in theory and
application.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. in Computer Science and
Economics program - the general regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate
document.
Program Objectives:
1. Understanding the foundations of Computer Science and Economics and their interface.
2. Understanding the principles of computing and its various aspects.
3. Understanding the fundamental principles and tools to analyze markets and design them
4. Understanding the principles of data science for solving problems in economics and
public policy.

Project (IP), Undergraduate Research (UR), or 8 to 12 credits can be earned from a B.Tech.
project (BTP). Students have to pursue at least one of these options. The program coordinator
and the BTP advisor has to certify that the project/course is on a relevant topic. Students are
encouraged to take up such projects in collaboration with the quantum technology industries in
India and abroad.
Prior knowledge: This minor program requires inter-disciplinary skills and is only intended
for students with a strong background in calculus, linear algebra and probability theory.
Benchmarking: A Minor program in quantum information and similar fields is not yet very
common in India, or even worldwide. Wherever they are offered, they require about 4-6 courses
along with a project. We have tried to retain that flavour with suitable adjustments added
keeping in mind our current course offering.
Sequencing: This is the recommended sequence of courses.

(2) The admission of a student may be cancelled by the Senate even at a later date if
it is found that the student had supplied some false information or suppressed any
relevant information while seeking admission.
Foreign Students
Some seats may be reserved for foreign students. These are usually
supernumerary, and admission for such seats is handled separately. The number
of seats and the process for application and admission are described in each year's
prospectus.
Non-degree Students
A non-degree student is a student registered for a degree in a recognized
university/ institute in India or abroad and who is officially sponsored by that
Institute/university to complete part of the academic requirements at IIIT-Delhi.
Such students may do courses or projects in IIIT-Delhi, and will be given
transcripts for the academic work carried out at IIIT-Delhi. During their stay at
IIIT-Delhi, such students will also be governed by all academic and disciplinary
rules of IIIT-Delhi. Credits earned by a non-degree student at IIIT-Delhi cannot
be applied towards any degree/diploma offered by IIIT-Delhi at any time. The
admission to non-degree status is decided on a case to case basis. The applications
are received by the DOAA.
4
Courses and Credits
(1) Every semester the Institute offers some courses, taught by faculty appointed by it.
(2) A course may be of 4, 2, or 1 credit. A registered student who passes a course earns the
credits assigned for that course.
a) A 4-credit course. The course will have 3 hours of lectures per week, with a total
of about 39 hours of lectures (13 weeks). In addition, one hour of interaction per
week is expected, which may be in form of structured tutorials. There may also be
labs in the course.
5
b) A 2-credit course. The course will have 1.5 hours of lectures per week for the
whole semester, or 3 hours of lectures per week for half the semester. The total
lectures hours will be about 20. Intensive short-term courses of 2 credits are also
possible, though it is expected that the duration of such a course will be no less than
3 weeks. A 2-credit course may or may not have tutorials and labs.
c) A 1-credit course. The course is likely to be run as a short course on a very
specialized topic. Such courses may also be run during vacations. A 1-credit course
will have a total of about 10 hours of lecture over a period of, generally, not less
than 2 weeks.
d) Certain courses such as Self-Growth (SG), Community Work (CW), may be
taken for varying number of credits on case-to-case basis.
(3) While taking courses in the Institute is the primary means for a student to earn credits,
there may be other approved provisions for earning credit through projects, studying in
other Institutions and transferring credits, etc. Such provisions will be provided in these
or other regulations.
(4) Online Courses
IIIT-Delhi has evolved a system for allowing students to take online courses. Students
can take advantage of the increasing amount of such courses made available by reputed
universities across the world to complement the courses offered in the institute.
1. A B.Tech. student is allowed to register for online courses (OC) as regular courses
(and not in the category of Independent Project (IP)/Independent Study
(IS)/Undergraduate Research (UR)/B.Tech. Project (BTP)).
2. The limit "one course in a semester" for OC means that "no more than 4 credits of
OC can be taken in a semester".
3. A student can take upto 8 credits of Online Courses in his B.Tech. degree.
(5) TA Duty
In a semester, student can earn a maximum of 2 credits for TAship in a 4-credit
course.
The grade for TAship can be S or X (same as an online course).
Credits earned for doing a TAship will be counted within the approved bucket
of 8 credits of online courses. UG students can take upto 4 credits as TA duty
under the rules as defined in the TA allocation policy.
For the purpose of counting overload, the load of TAship will be considered
equivalent to that of a 4 credit course.
6
5
Registration
(1) At the beginning of each semester, a student shall register for the courses he/she wishes
to take in that semester. A student shall normally be allowed to register for a course
only if he/she has passed all the necessary pre-requisites for that course.
(2) Registration is compulsory for all students who are not on leave of absence, and is the
sole responsibility of the student and must be completed before the last date of
registration. Failure to register may lead to termination of the student for that semester.
5.1 Registration Procedure
(1) Registration will generally be done just before the start of classes in a semester. Pre-
registration for a semester can be done toward the end of the previous semester. Students
will be informed about these dates and other details every semester.
(2) Registration process has two parts: academic and administrative, and both of these must
be completed in order to complete the registration process. Academic registration includes
specifying the courses that the student wishes to do in the semester and getting the
necessary approvals. Students can seek advice from Advisors nominated for the purpose by
the DOAA. Administrative part includes paying all dues to the Institute.
(3) If a student does not register on ERP, (s)he will be marked "Absent Without Leave". If
a candidate remains "Absent Without Leave" for two semesters, his/her registration shall
be terminated and a termination letter will be issued to the student with a copy to the Head
of the Department.
5.2 Late Registration
Late registration is permitted as per academic calendar on the payment of late registration
fee. The late fee may be waived if the delay is due to an academic activity undertaken with
prior permission. The number of days missed due to late arrival shall be treated as leave of
absence. A fee for late academic registration may be imposed.
5.3 Pre-registration of Courses
Pre-registration is necessary part of the academic registration for non-first semester
students. In case a student fails to do pre-registration of courses, a penalty may be imposed
if the student does not register his/her preference within the stipulated period.
5.4 Adding or Dropping of Courses
A student can change the courses that he/she does in a semester by adding and dropping
courses till the last date for add/drop as specified in the academic calendar. In addition, a
student can withdraw from at most one elective course up to the last date specified in the
7
academic calendar, which will normally be after the mid-semester examination. During the
summer term, a student may be permitted to drop one course by the late drop date.
5.5 Registration of Students with Backlog Course(s)
A student has a backlog if he/she has not taken or has taken but failed in course(s) of
previous semester(s). The registration of such a student must be approved by the DOAA
who will advise the student. Generally, the student should register in a manner that he/she
can clear as many backlog courses as are available.
5.6 Cancellation of registration
(1) A student is solely responsible to ensure that all conditions for proper registration are
satisfied, and there are no timetable clashes. The registration may be cancelled by the
DOAA for a course if any irregularity is found at a later stage. A student's registration
for the semester may be cancelled as part of disciplinary action. Leave beyond
permissible limits may also result in cancellation of registration for a semester.
5.7 Summer term registration
Registering in the summer term is optional. A student may register for up to 6 credits of
courses that are offered during the summer term (inclusive of SG/CW credits). Out of these
6 credits, for students who have completed the 2nd year of their B.Tech. program, may be
allowed to take up to 4 credits for IP/IS/UR/BTP. An exception may be made for the
students of the graduating batch, who may be allowed to take up to 8 credits. The
registration shall be done just before the start of the term. There will not be any late
registration in the summer term and a student shall not be allowed to add a course after
registration.
5.8 Academic Load
In general, students will take courses as per the program. Normal load for the firstand
second-year students is 16-20 credits and for the thirdand fourth-year students is 16-22
credits.
When a student registers for more credits than the stipulated normal load, it is called the
overload. First year students cannot take any overload. Second year students having a
CGPA of more than 8.0 can take an overload of up to 2 additional credits over 20 credits.
Thirdand fourth-year students having a CGPA of more than 8.0 can take an overload of
up to 2 additional credits over 22 credits. If a student is not having CGPA more than 8.0
may be allowed to take an overload only in one semester in the final year, i.e., in either 7th
or 8th semester.
When the student registers for less than 16 credits in a semester, it is called the underload.
A student may be allowed, with permission of the DOAA an underload of a maximum of 4
credits below 16 credits.
8
Students under academic warning may not be permitted any overload. Such students may
be advised by DOAA to take an underload.
Students can avail underload below 12 credits (as low as 4 credits) only in the eighth
semester of their B.Tech. program. Students wanting to avail internship (industrial,
academic, research, etc.) without taking semester leave can do so under this clause
provided they satisfy the below criteria:
Eligibility to apply for internship at the end of Semester 6
(1)
Must have completed 126 credits.
(2)
Must have done 4 credits of SG and CW credits in addition to 126 credits.
(3)
Must have completed all core courses.
(4)
Must have been left with 4 credits of IP/IS/UR/Online courses/BTP. Must be
eligible to do these courses and must have necessary approval of the advisor with
whom he will do these credits.
Only eligible students as informed by Academic office to the placement office will be
allowed to sit for internship interviews.
Eligibility to go for internship at the end of Semester 7
(1)
Must have completed 148 credits.
(2)
Must have done 4 credits of SG and CW credits in addition to 148 credits.
(3)

whom he will do these credits.
Students willing to go for internship need to take necessary approval from DoAA. Such
request needs to be placed at least two days before the last date of add/drop. Students
approved for such internship are required to register for 4 credits of only
IP/IS/UR/BTP/OC courses in the eighth semester. Students will not be allowed to do any
in-class course during the internship period.
6 Teaching and Evaluation
6.1 Teaching
Each course is conducted by the Instructor-in-charge with the assistance of tutors and/or
teaching assistants. The Instructor-in-charge is responsible for conducting the lectures,
tutorials, and labs, holding the tests and examinations, evaluating the performance of the
students, awarding grades at the end of the semester/summer term, and transmitting the
grades to the DOAA's office within the prescribed time limit.
6.2 Continuous Evaluation System
(1) The Institute follows a system of continuous evaluation, in which, during a course,
various instruments like tests, exams, assignments, projects, etc., are given by the
9
instructor to assess the learning of students and assign grades. All evaluations are the
responsibility of the instructor in-charge of the course. The two main exams - the mid-
semester exam and the end-semester exam - shall normally be scheduled as per the
academic calendar while the schedule of the rest will be decided by the Instructor. For 1
or 2 credit courses, the Instructor will decide the evaluation criteria and the schedule of
tests and exams.
(2) Make-up Exam: If a student, for valid reasons such as illness, etc., fails to appear in the
end-semester examination in one or more course(s), he/she may make a request to the
instructor and the academic office for a make-up examination within two days of the date
of the scheduled examination. The request for make-up examination will be approved by
the DOAA. Such a request must, however, be supported by proper documentary evidence
for justifying the request. For medical reasons, only two medical applications including
mid-semester and end-semester would be accepted for make-up examinations during the
entire duration of the B.Tech. degree completion. Further, for the grant of medical leave,
students are required to upload the medical certificate within five working days from the
date of the missed examination.The Institute reserves the right to get the medical
certificate verified from the Institute doctor. The makeup exam should be conducted, and
the final grade should be provided within six weeks after the moderation date.
6.3 Grading Scheme
(1) One of the letter grades given in the following table shall be awarded to a student
reflecting his/her overall performance in a course. Each letter grade carries certain points
as given in the table, and these points are used in the computation of the SGPA/CGPA as
explained later.
Letter Grade
Grade
Points
Remarks
A+ (Outstanding)
10
Letter grades A+ to F and I are given only in the
regular courses.
This grading scheme is effectively A to F. A+ grade is
only to recognize excellent performers in a course,
though it has the same grade points as an A grade.
A (Very Good)
10
A(-)
9
B (Good)
8
B(-)
7
C (Satisfactory)
6
C(-)
5
D (Marginal)
4
F (Fail)
2
F Grade is not counted in the calculation of CGPA,
however, it is counted in the calculation of SGPA.
I (Incomplete)
Nil
Incomplete (I grade) must be converted to one of the
letter grades (A to F) within six weeks after
moderation date.
W(Withdrawn)
Nil
"W" grade shall be printed in the transcript of the
students who do ‘Late Drop'
S (Satisfactory)
Nil
S and X are grades for only certain kinds of courses
like Audit course. They are not incorporated in
SGPA/CGPA calculation.
X (Unsatisfactory)
Nil
10
(2) In the academic courses, the final grades awarded are A to F (A+ is a grade with same
points as A, and is there to honor excellence).
(3) An I (Incomplete) grade may be awarded in cases when all the requirements for a course
are not met by the student at the time of submission of grades and it essentially reflects as
an "incomplete" status in the Evaluation Resource Planning (ERP) system. For all
courses including project-based courses, this grade must be converted to a regular grade
within six weeks after the moderation date. For courses other than project / independent
study, incomplete grade "I" is meant primarily for medical reasons. All unconverted "I"
grades are automatically converted to F grade after the grade conversion deadline, which
is within six weeks after the moderation date.
(4) In certain courses, such as Online Courses (OC, Self-Growth (SG and Community Work
(CW courses, only S or X grade is awarded.
(5) The F and X grades are "fail" grades and the student shall be required to repeat the
course. If the course is a compulsory course, the student shall repeat the same course in
another semester/summer when the course is offered. In the case of an elective/optional
course, the student can replace the course by another elective course.
(6) For at most one compulsory (core) course, after getting an F twice in the course, a student
may be allowed to replace it by an elective course of the respective discipline with the
prior approval from DOAA.
(7) An F and X grade obtained in any course shall be reflected in the grade sheet. However,
when the course is replaced or repeated, the new grade will be used for computation of
the CGPA. The pass grade for the respective course will count towards the SGPA of the
semester in which the course is passed and not in the semester where ‘F' grade was
awarded. ‘F' grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, although it is
counted in the calculation of SGPA.
6.4
Change of Grade Already Awarded
As mentioned in Ordinances, a letter grade, once awarded, shall not be changed unless
the request is made by the Instructor-in-Charge of the course and is approved by the
Chairman, Senate. Any such request for change of grade must, however, be made within
six weeks after the moderation date with all relevant records and justification.
6.5
(i) Grade Improvement
For some important core courses, refresher modules may be offered during vacations for
students' benefit. Based on their performance in the refresher module, only students with
F or D grade may be allowed at most half the letter grade improvement (i.e.
improvement from F to D or D to C-), although any student can attend. Decision
regarding whether these modules are to be offered during vacation and whether they may
be used for grade enhancement will be taken every year. As with a grade change, this
grade improvement will be approved and authorized by Chairman, Senate.
11
(ii) UG students to repeat (Improvement) of a particular course
Repeat of a course completed with pass grade may be allowed, but only the best Grade in
that course will be counted for CGPA computation. Also, all attempts in that course will
be recorded in the respective semesters' transcripts and the repeat course will not be
permitted for late drop after mid-semester examination. For repeating a course, a student
has to simply register on ERP during the course registration period.
6.6 Performance Indicators
(1) The semester performance is indicated by a Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)
which is a weighted sum of all the points earned in the courses done in a semester. The
SGPA is given for each semester and is computed using the following formula.
SGPA = (u1.w1 + u2.w2 + … + un.wn) / (u1 + u2 + … + un)
where ui is the number of credits for the course i and wi is the points earned through the
letter grade in that course, and n is the number of courses taken in the semester. While
doing the computation of SGPA, the course/thesis credits with grades S and X are
ignored.
(2) The overall performance is indicated by a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)
which is computed in the same manner as the computation of SGPA but for all the
courses done in the program.
‘F' grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, however, it is counted in the
calculation of SGPA.
(3) The grades in courses will be announced over ERP at the end of every semester. A grade
report for the semester may be issued to a student after the semester upon request. The
grade report may be withheld if the student has not paid the fees or other dues, has a
disciplinary case pending against him/her, has not completed other formalities, or for any
other pertinent reason.
6.7 Transfer of Credits & Grades
Students may be permitted to do academic work and courses in places of repute outside
IIIT-Delhi and may be allowed to spend up to 2 semesters at another University. The
maximum credit transfer allowed is 40 credits over the entire B.Tech. program (with a
maximum of 20 credits in a semester).
Credits: Based on their performance/quantum of work done and the contents of the
course/work, some credits obtained from similar courses/projects may be transferred and
considered towards graduation requirements. This transfer of credits will be approved on
a case-by-case basis by the DOAA and will be reported to the Senate.
12
Grades: In general, the grades corresponding to the transferred credits will not be counted
towards the SGPA/CGPA calculation; however, if there is an MoU with the University
and the MoU permits, then the grades will be included in the SGPA/CGPA calculation.
6.8
B.Tech. students are allowed to do "extra credits" beyond 156 credits
B.Tech. students are allowed to do "extra credits" beyond 156 credits required for
completion of B.Tech. requirement. For N extra credits done, the student will be allowed
worst grades in N credits, with a maximum limit of at most 8 credits, to be not counted
towards CGPA computation. The impact of this decision will be reviewed after two
batches have graduated with this option. Following method will be used for calculating
the CGPA:
Method: The below method will automatically decide which extra credits will not be
counted in CGPA:
For CGPA computation at the end of 6th semester, baseline credits will be 116 (equal to
29 full courses including OC but excluding SG & CW). If a student has done N credits
more than 116, then for CGPA computation the following will be done:
-
The worst grades in courses totaling M credits will be "removed", where
M= min {8, N}.
-
CGPA will be computed based on the remaining credits. It is to be noted
that since OC's are with S/X Grades, although they will be included in
baseline 116 credits, they will not be counted in CGPA. For example, if a
student has done 120 credits including OC of 4 credits, CGPA will be
computed from best grades corresponding to 112 credits.
For CGPA computation at the end of 7th semester, baseline credits will be 136
(including OC but excluding SG & CW).
CGPA computation for Honors students at the end of 8th semester will be done similar to
a non-Honors student, i.e., s/he will be allowed to not-count worst grades of courses up
to 8 credits. For example, if a student has done 164 credits (excluding SG/CW credits)
including OC of 4 credits, CGPA will be computed from best grades corresponding to
152 credits.
General Rules:
SGPA computation will remain the same for each semester.
CGPA computation will remain the same for first 5 semesters, even if a student has done
"extra credits."
6.9 A B.Tech. student, who has already completed his/her graduation requirement (including
registration for a minimum of 8 semesters on campus), will be allowed to register for at
most two extra courses to improve his/her CGPA. Registration after completion of 156
13
credits, required for graduation, will be allowed in only one extra semester. Further,
registration of extra credits will be permitted provided he/she pays fees for that extra
semester. Moreover, such students will not be considered for any award/medal.
7
Continuing in the Program
For continuing in the undergraduate program, the student has to show satisfactory academic
performance as may be defined by the Senate from time to time. If the academic
performance falls short, a student may be asked to repeat the first year, placed under
warning, or his/her program may be terminated.
7.1 Rules for the first year (excluding the summer term scheduled after the first year)
(i)
If a student fails in any 5 or more courses after completing 1st year, i.e., 1st and 2nd
regular semesters (excluding summer), provided he/she did not take semester leave in
any of the two semesters, then he/she will have to repeat the first year.
(ii)
For the students who are repeating the first year, the termination clause (7.3 clause of
UG regulation) will be applicable.
(iii)
A student repeating the first year may be allowed transfer of credits only for the
communication (COM101) and SSH courses that he/she had passed in his/her
previous attempts.
7.2 Academic Warning/Probation
A student shall be placed under academic warning/probation "if he/she gets an
SGPA/CGPA of 4.5 or less at the end of a semester", however this will not lead to
termination of the student.
The following will apply to a student who is placed on a warning (academic as well as
warning due to disciplinary reasons):
(1) The student will not be allowed to hold any elected or nominated post for any
institute body including the hostel management, students' activities, and student
council.
(2) The student will not be allowed to participate in any event outside the Institute as
member of the Institute team.
(3) No academic overload shall be permitted to such students.
(4) The students may be required by the DOAA to take an underload.
14
(5) The student will be required to sign an undertaking to agree and follow all stipulated
conditions of warning. All such undertakings shall be countersigned by the
parent/guardian of the student.
7.3 Rules for promotion to next semester for 1st year (Only Repeaters), 2nd, 3rd and 4th
year students.
If a student gets academic warning because of low SGPA (of <4.0) in two consecutive
semesters and/or gets two or more F grades each in two consecutive semesters, his/her
program will be terminated.
7.4 Attendance and Leave of Absence
(1) A student is expected to attend all classes. For any absence of more than two days, the
student should apply for and take a leave of absence. Penalty for students' whose
attendance falls below a threshold will be as decided by Senate from time to time, and
communicated to students.
(2) A student may be allowed to take semester leave, with permission before the last date of
add/drop, for any valid reason, as determined by AAC, including but not limited to ill
health, internships, entrepreneurship, family requirements, etc. No semester leave will be
granted after the last date of add/drop other than for the critical reasons such as ill health
(In such cases, no fee refund is admissible if the student has registered for the semester
which is converted to the semester leave later.) A student shall not be permitted more
than four semester leaves in the entire program. Any circumstance leading to more than
four semester leave/drop may result in the automatic termination of the program. This
implies that a student has to necessarily be registered and physically be present on
campus for 8 semesters during his/her degree program except during the last semester
when a student can go for internship, provided he satisfies the eligibility criteria to go for
internship.
(3) If a student is absent from the Institute for more than 20 days in a semester due to
medical or any other reason, this may be converted to a semester leave for that semester
by DOAA. However, if a student represents IIIT-Delhi in some event, with prior
permission of Dean of Students Affairs, absence due to this participation will not be
counted.
7.5 Appeals
A student, whose program has been terminated, may appeal against the decision. All such
appeals shall be made to the Senate within two weeks, and the decision of the Academic
Senate shall be final. Other academics related appeals may be made to AAC.
15
7.6 Branch Transfer
Transfer of B.Tech. students from one program to the other is possible only after the
grades of the first semester are out. This is the only time branch change will occur. A
student must make an explicit request to be considered for program transfer within a week
from the date of announcement of results of the first semester. In his/her request, the
student can mention more than one program in the order of preference. Rules for program
transfer are:
1.
Only the students who satisfy eligibility for a particular branch at the time of admission
are eligible for transfer to that branch.
2.
Students admitted through AICTE need to produce NOC from AICTE if applying for
transfer to another program.
3.
Students must have passed all credits specified for the first semester of the B.Tech.
program.
4.
To be eligible for transfer to Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Computer Science
and Applied Mathematics (CSAM) or Computer Science and Design (CSD) program or
Computer Science and Social Sciences (CSSS) program or Computer Science and
Biosciences (CSB) program or Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAI)
program, a student must have received a B or better grade in Introduction to Programming
(IP) and Mathematics-I.
5.
To be eligible for transfer to Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) or
Electronics and VLSI Engineering (EVE) program, a student must have received a B or
better grade in both Digital Circuits and Mathematics-I.
Students eligible for program transfer will be ordered in a priority list based on CGPA and
will be granted transfer in order as long as the strength of each program does not violate the
following limits.
6.
The base strength of a program for a batch will be the number of students who were
admitted and who are still enrolled in the program as on Dec 15 (after Sem 1) after
completion of one semester, not counting those who were repeating the first year. (E.g.
Suppose 110 students were admitted in a batch and there were 8 repeaters. If 6 of the
admitted students dropped out before Dec 15, then the base strength will be 110-6=104).
The final strength of any program shall not reduce by more than 10% of its base strength.
Also, the final strength of any program shall not increase by more than 10% of its base
strength.
Repeaters who are repeating first year are also allowed branch transfer under the
above-mentioned rules.
In case of a tie in CGPA of students, below tie breaking rules will be followed for
deciding transfer from one branch to another
16
Tie Breaking Rule I - For transfer to CSE, CSAI, CSAM, CSD, CSSS and CSB branches,
higher grade in the order of Introduction to Programming, Maths-I, Introduction to HCI,
Digital Circuits, Communication Skills
Tie Breaking Rule II -Higher JEE Rank

university/ institute in India or abroad and who is officially sponsored by that
Institute/university to complete part of the academic requirements at IIIT-Delhi.
Such students may do courses or projects in IIIT-Delhi, and will be given
transcripts for the academic work carried out at IIIT-Delhi. During their stay at
IIIT-Delhi, such students will also be governed by all academic and disciplinary
rules of IIIT-Delhi. Credits earned by a non-degree student at IIIT-Delhi cannot
be applied towards any degree/diploma offered by IIIT-Delhi at any time. The
admission to non-degree status is decided on a case to case basis. The applications
are received by the DOAA.
4
Courses and Credits
(1) Every semester the Institute offers some courses, taught by faculty appointed by it.
(2) A course may be of 4, 2, or 1 credit. A registered student who passes a course earns the
credits assigned for that course.
a) A 4-credit course. The course will have 3 hours of lectures per week, with a total of
about 39 hours of lectures (13 weeks). In addition, one hour of interaction per week
is expected, which may be in form of structured tutorials. There may also be labs in
the course.
5
b) A 2-credit course. The course will have 1.5 hours of lectures per week for the whole
semester, or 3 hours of lectures per week for half the semester. The total lectures
hours will be about 20. Intensive short-term courses of 2 credits are also possible,
though it is expected that the duration of such a course will be no less than 3 weeks.
A 2-credit course may or may not have tutorials and labs.
c) A 1-credit course. The course is likely to be run as a short course on a very
specialized topic. Such courses may also be run during vacations. A 1-credit course
will have a total of about 10 hours of lecture over a period of, generally, not less than
2 weeks.
d) Certain courses such as Self-Growth (SG), Community Work (CW), may be taken
for varying number of credits on case to case basis.
(3) While taking courses in the Institute is the primary means for a student to earn credits,
there may be other approved provisions for earning credit through projects, studying in
other Institutions and transferring credits, etc. Such provisions will be provided in these
or other regulations.
(4) Online Courses
IIIT-Delhi has evolved a system for allowing students to take online courses. Students
can take advantage of the increasing amount of such courses made available by reputed
universities across the world to complement the courses offered in the institute.
1. A B.Tech. student is allowed to register for online courses (OC) as regular courses
(and not in the category of Independent Project (IP)/Independent Study
(IS)/Undergraduate Research (UR)/B.Tech. Project (BTP)).
2. The limit "one course in a semester" for OC means that "no more than 4 credits of
OC can be taken in a semester".
3. A student can take upto 8 credits of Online Courses in his B.Tech. degree.
(5) TA Duty
UG students can take upto 4 cr as TA duty under the rules as defined in the TA allocation
policy. TAship will be floated as a 2-credit course similar to an online course. For a TA
duty for a 4 Cr course student will get 2 Cr. The grade for which can be S or X (same as
an online course). These 4 credits will be counted within the approved bucket of 8
credits of online courses.
6
5
Registration
(1) At the beginning of each semester, a student shall register for the courses he/she wishes
to take in that semester. A student shall normally be allowed to register for a course only
if he/she has passed all the necessary pre-requisites for that course.
(2) Registration is compulsory for all students who are not on leave of absence, and is the
sole responsibility of the student and must be completed before the last date of
registration. Failure to register may lead to termination of the student for that semester.
5.1 Registration Procedure
(1) Registration will generally be done just before the start of classes in a semester. Pre-
registration for a semester can be done toward the end of the previous semester. Students
will be informed about these dates and other details every semester.
(2) Registration process has two parts: academic and administrative, and both of these must
be completed in order to complete the registration process. Academic registration includes
specifying the courses that the student wishes to do in the semester and getting the necessary
approvals. Students can seek advice from Advisors nominated for the purpose by the DOAA.
Administrative part includes paying all dues to the Institute.
5.2 Late Registration
Late registration is permitted as per academic calendar on the payment of late registration
fee. The late fee may be waived if the delay is due to an academic activity undertaken with
prior permission. The number of days missed due to late arrival shall be treated as leave of
absence. A fee for late academic registration may be imposed.
5.3 Pre-registration of Courses
Pre-registration is necessary part of the academic registration for non-first semester students.
In case a student fails to do pre-registration of courses, a penalty may be imposed if the
student does not register his/her preference within the stipulated period.
5.4 Adding or Dropping of Courses
A student can change the courses that he/she does in a semester by adding and dropping
courses till the last date for add/drop as specified in the academic calendar. In addition, a
student can withdraw from at most one elective course up to the last date specified in the
academic calendar, which will normally be after the mid-semester examination. During the
summer term, a student may be permitted to drop one course by the late drop date.
5.5 Registration of Students with Backlog Course(s)
A student has a backlog if he/she has not taken or has taken but failed in course(s) of previous
semester(s). The registration of such a student must be approved by the DOAA who will
7
advise the student. Generally, the student should register in a manner that he/she can clear
as many backlog courses as are available.
5.6 Cancellation of registration
A student is solely responsible to ensure that all conditions for proper registration are
satisfied, and there are no timetable clashes. The registration may be cancelled by the DOAA
for a course if any irregularity is found at a later stage. A student's registration for the
semester may be cancelled as part of disciplinary action. Leave beyond permissible limits
may also result in cancellation of registration for a semester.
5.7 Summer term registration
Registering in the summer term is optional. A student may register for up to 6 credits of
courses that are offered during the summer term (inclusive of SG/CW credits). Out of these
6 credits, for students who have completed the 2nd year of their B.Tech. program, may be
allowed to take up to 4 credits for IP/IS/UR/BTP. An exception may be made for the students
of the graduating batch, who may be allowed to take up to 8 credits. The registration shall
be done just before the start of the term. There will not be any late registration in the summer
term and a student shall not be allowed to add a course after registration.
5.8 Academic Load
In general, students will take courses as per the program. Normal load for the first and second
year students is 16-20 credits and for the third and fourth year students is 16-22 credits.
When a student registers for more credits than the stipulated normal load, it is called the
overload. First year students cannot take any overload. Second year students having a CGPA
of more than 8.0 can take an overload of up to 2 additional credits over 20 credits. Third and
fourth year students having a CGPA of more than 8.0 can take an overload of up to 2
additional credits over 22 credits.
When the student registers for less than 16 credits in a semester, it is called the underload. A
student may be allowed, with permission of the DOAA an underload of a maximum of 4
credits below 16 credits.
Students under academic warning may not be permitted any overload. Such students may be
advised by DOAA to take an underload.
Students can avail underload below 12 credits (as low as 4 credits) only in the eighth
semester of their B.Tech. program. Students wanting to avail internship (industrial,
academic, research, etc.) without taking semester leave can do so under this clause provided
they satisfy the below criteria:
Eligibility to apply for internship at the end of Semester 6
(1)
Must have completed 126 credits.
(2)
Must have done 4 cr of SG and CW credits in addition to 126 credits.
(3)
Must have completed all core courses.
8
(4)
Must have been left with 4 cr of IP/IS/UR/Online courses/BTP. Must be eligible
to do these courses and must have necessary approval of the advisor with whom
he will do these credits.
Only eligible students as informed by Academic office to the placement office will be
allowed to sit for internship interviews.
Eligibility to go for internship at the end of Semester 7
(1)
Must have completed 148 credits.
(2)
Must have done 4 cr of SG and CW credits in addition to 148 credits.
(3)
Must have completed all core courses and other graduation requirements pending
a 4 cr IP/IS/UR/Online course/BTP.
(4)

to do these courses and must have necessary approval of the advisor with whom
he will do these credits.
Students willing to go for internship need to take necessary approval from DoAA. Such
request needs to be placed at least two days before the last date of add/drop. Students
approved for such internship are required to register for 4 credits of only IP/IS/UR/BTP/OC
courses in the eighth semester. Students will not be allowed to do any in-class course during
the internship period.
6
Teaching and Evaluation
6.1 Teaching
Each course is conducted by the Instructor-in-charge with the assistance of tutors and/or
teaching assistants. The Instructor-in-charge is responsible for conducting the lectures,
tutorials, and labs, holding the tests and examinations, evaluating the performance of the
students, awarding grades at the end of the semester/summer term, and transmitting the
grades to the DOAA's office within the prescribed time limit.
6.2 Continuous Evaluation System
(1) The Institute follows a system of continuous evaluation, in which, during a course, various
instruments like tests, exams, assignments, projects, etc., are given by the instructor to
assess the learning of students and assign grades. All evaluations are the responsibility of
the instructor in-charge of the course. The two main exams - the mid-semester exam and
the end-semester exam - shall normally be scheduled as per the academic calendar while
9
the schedule of the rest will be decided by the Instructor. For 1 or 2 credit courses, the
Instructor will decide the evaluation criteria and the schedule of tests and exams.
(2) Make-up Exam: If a student, for valid reasons such as illness, etc., fails to appear in the
end-semester examination in one or more course(s), he/she may make a request to the
instructor and the academic office for a make-up examination within two days of the date
of the scheduled examination. Such a request must, however, be supported by proper
documentary evidence for justifying the request. For medical reasons, only two medical
applications including mid-semester and end-semester would be accepted for make-up
examinations during the entire duration of the B.Tech. degree completion. Further, for the
grant of medical leave, students are required to upload the medical certificate within five
working days from the date of the missed examination. The Institute reserves the right to
get the medical certificate verified from the Institute Doctor. Finally, the request for make-
up examination will be approved by the DOAA.
6.3 Grading Scheme
(1) One of the letter grades given in the following table shall be awarded to a student reflecting
his/her overall performance in a course. Each letter grade carries certain points as given in
the table, and these points are used in the computation of the SGPA/CGPA as explained
later.
Letter Grade
Grade
Points
Remarks
A+ (Outstanding)
10
Letter grades A+ to F and I are given only in the
regular courses.
This grading scheme is effectively A to F. A+ grade
is only to recognize excellent performers in a course,
though it has the same grade points as an A grade.
A (Very Good)
10
A(-)
9
B (Good)
8
B(-)
7
C (Satisfactory)
6
C(-)
5
D (Marginal)
4
F (Fail)
2
F Grade is not counted in the calculation of CGPA,
however, it is counted in the calculation of SGPA.
I (Incomplete)
Nil
Incomplete (I grade) must be converted to one of
the letter grades (A to F) as per the academic
calendar
W(Withdrawn)
Nil
"W" grade shall be printed in the transcript of the
students who do ‘Late Drop'
S (Satisfactory)
Nil
S and X are grades for only certain kinds of courses
like Audit course. They are not incorporated in
SGPA/CGPA calculation.
X (Unsatisfactory)
Nil
10
(2) In the academic courses, the final grades awarded are A to F (A+ is a grade with same
points as A, and is there to honor excellence).
(3) An I (Incomplete) grade may be awarded in cases when all the requirements for a course
are not met by the student at the time of submission of grades and it essentially reflects as
an "incomplete" status in the Evaluation Resource Planning (ERP) system. For all courses
including project-based courses, this grade must be converted to a regular grade within one
month of the end of the current term (i.e., the moderation date). For courses other than
project / independent study, incomplete grade "I" is meant primarily for medical reasons.
All unconverted "I" grades are automatically converted to F grade after the grade
conversion deadline, which is one month after the moderation date.
(4) In certain courses, such as Online Courses (OC, Self-Growth (SG and Community Work
(CW courses, only S or X grade is awarded.
(5) The F and X grades are "fail" grades and the student shall be required to repeat the course.
If the course is a compulsory course, the student shall repeat the same course in another
semester/summer when the course is offered. In the case of an elective/optional course, the
student can replace the course by another elective course.
(6) For at most one compulsory (core) course, after getting an F twice in the course, a student
may be allowed to replace it by an elective course of the respective discipline with the prior
approval from DOAA.
(7) An F and X grade obtained in any course shall be reflected in the grade sheet. However,
when the course is replaced or repeated, the new grade will be used for computation of the
CGPA. The pass grade for the respective course will count towards the SGPA of the
semester in which the course is passed and not in the semester where ‘F' grade was
awarded. ‘F' grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, although it is counted
in the calculation of SGPA.
6.4
Change of Grade Already Awarded
As mentioned in Ordinances, a letter grade, once awarded, shall not be changed unless the
request is made by the Instructor-in-Charge of the course and is approved by the Chairman,
Senate. Any such request for change of grade must, however, be made within four weeks
of the start of the next semester with all relevant records and justification.
6.5
(i) Grade Improvement
For some important core courses, refresher modules may be offered during vacations for
students' benefit. Based on their performance in the refresher module, only students with
F or D grade may be allowed at most half the letter grade improvement (i.e. improvement
from F to D or D to C- -), although any student can attend. Decision regarding whether
these modules are to be offered during vacation and whether they may be used for grade
11
enhancement will be taken every year. As with a grade change, this grade improvement
will be approved and authorized by Chairman, Senate.
(ii) UG students to repeat (Improvement) of a particular course
Repeat of a course completed with pass grade may be allowed, but only the best Grade in
that course will be counted for CGPA computation. Also, all attempts in that course will
be recorded in the respective semesters' transcripts and the repeat course will not be
permitted for late drop after mid-semester examination. For repeating a course, a student
has to simply register on ERP during the course registration period.
6.6 Performance Indicators
(1) The semester performance is indicated by a Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) which
is a weighted sum of all the points earned in the courses done in a semester. The SGPA is
given for each semester and is computed using the following formula.
SGPA = (u1.w1 + u2.w2 + … + un.wn) / (u1 + u2 + … + un)
where ui is the number of credits for the course i and wi is the points earned through the
letter grade in that course, and n is the number of courses taken in the semester. While
doing the computation of SGPA, the course/thesis credits with grades S and X are ignored.
(2) The overall performance is indicated by a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) which
is computed in the same manner as the computation of SGPA but for all the courses done
in the program.
‘F' grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, however, it is counted in the
calculation of SGPA.
(3) The grades in courses will be announced over ERP at the end of every semester. A grade
report for the semester may be issued to a student after the semester upon request. The
grade report may be withheld if the student has not paid the fees or other dues, has a
disciplinary case pending against him/her, has not completed other formalities, or for any
other pertinent reason.
6.7 Transfer of Credits
Students may be permitted to do academic work and courses in places of repute outside
IIIT-Delhi and may be allowed to spend up to 2 semesters at another University. The
maximum credit transfer allowed is 40 credits over the entire B.Tech. program (with a
maximum of 20 credits in a semester). Based on their performance/quantum of work done
and the contents of the course/work, some credits may be transferred for similar
courses/projects. Institutions with which IIIT-Delhi has arrangements/MOU/student
12
exchange programs, transfer of credits may also be permitted. This transfer of credits will
be approved on a case-by-case basis by the DOAA and will be reported to the Senate.
6.8
B.Tech. students are allowed to do "extra credits" beyond 156 credits

B.Tech. students are allowed to do "extra credits" beyond 156 credits required for
completion of B.Tech. requirement. For N extra credits done, the student will be allowed
worst grades in N credits, with a maximum limit of at most 8 credits, to be not counted
towards CGPA computation. The impact of this decision will be reviewed after two
batches have graduated with this option. Following method will be used for calculating
the CGPA:
Method: The below method will automatically decide which extra credits will not be
counted in CGPA:

For CGPA computation at the end of 6th semester, baseline credits will be 116
(equal to 29 full courses including OC but excluding SG & CW). If a student has done
N credits more than 116, then for CGPA computation the following will be done:
- The worst grades in courses totaling M credits will be "removed", where M=
min{8, N}.
- CGPA will be computed based on the remaining credits. It is to be noted that since OC's
are with S/X Grades, although they will be included in baseline 116 credits, they will
not be counted in CGPA. For example, if a student has done 120 credits including OC
of 4 credits, CGPA will be computed from best grades corresponding to 112 credits.

For CGPA computation at the end of 7th semester, baseline credits will be 136 (including
OC but excluding SG & CW).

CGPA computation for Honors students at the end of 8th semester will be done similar to
a non-Honors student, i.e., s/he will be allowed to not-count worst grades of courses up
to 8 credits. For example, if a student has done 164 credits (excluding SG/CW credits)
including OC of 4 credits, CGPA will be computed from best grades corresponding to
152 credits.
General Rules:

SGPA computation will remain the same for each semester.

CGPA computation will remain the same for first 5 semesters, even if a student has done
"extra credits."
6.9 B.Tech. student, who has already completed his/her graduation requirement (including
registration for a minimum of 8 semesters on campus), will be allowed to register for at most
two extra courses to improve his/her CGPA. Registration after completion of 156 credits,
13
required for graduation, will be allowed in only one extra semester. Further, registration of
extra credits will be permitted provided he/she pays fees for that extra semester. Moreover,
such students will not be considered for any award/medal.
7
Continuing in the Program
For continuing in the undergraduate program, the student has to show satisfactory academic
performance as may be defined by the Senate from time to time. If the academic performance
falls short, a student may be asked to repeat the first year, placed under warning, or his/her
program may be terminated.
7.1 Rules for the first year (excluding the summer term scheduled after the first year)
(1) A student will be put on probation at the end of the first semester, if he/she passes 2 or
less technical courses (courses other than Communication Skills) in the first semester.
For details about department wise technical and non-technical courses of first year,
refer program-wise regulations.
(2) If a student passes 3 or less technical courses in the entire first year provided he/she
did not take semester leave in any of the two semester, his/her program will be
terminated.
If a student passes 3 or less technical courses in the entire first year and was on leave
in either of the two semesters, he will have to repeat the first year, i.e., he/she has to do
first semester in the next academic year and will not be allowed to continue with the
third semester.
(3) If a student passes 4 or 5 technical courses in the entire first year, he/she will have to
repeat the year. Further, if a student passes 3 or less technical courses in the first
semester, he/she will be allowed to take semester leave in the Semester 2 or can
continue in Semester 2. However, in both the cases, he has to follow rule 2 mentioned
above.
(4) If a student repeating the first year fails in more than 1 technical courses in either
semester of the repeat year, his/her program will be terminated.
(5) A student repeating the first year may be allowed transfer of credits only for the non-
technical courses that he/she had passed in his/her previous attempt.
Regular rules for backlog will apply for any courses he/she may have failed.
7.2 Academic Warning/Probation
14
A student shall be placed under academic warning/probation on the grounds of inadequate
academic performance for one (subsequent) semester
(1) If he/she fails in any course in a semester
(2) If he/she gets an SGPA of 4.5 or less in a semester, or has a CGPA of 4.5 or less at the
end of the semester.
The following will apply to a student who is placed on a warning (academic as well as
warning due to disciplinary reasons):
(1) The student will not be allowed to hold any elected or nominated post for any institute
body including the hostel management, students' activities, and student council.
(2) The student will not be allowed to participate in any event outside the Institute as
member of the Institute team.
(3) No academic overload shall be permitted to such students.
(4) The students may be required by the DOAA to take an underload.
(5) The student will be required to sign an undertaking to agree and follow all stipulated
conditions of warning. All such undertakings shall be countersigned by the
parent/guardian of the student.
7.3 Rules for promotion to next semester for 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students.
If a student gets academic warning because of low SGPA (of <4.0) in two consecutive
semesters and/or gets two or more F grades each in two consecutive semesters, his/her
program will be terminated.
7.4 Attendance and Leave of Absence
(1) A student is expected to attend all classes. For any absence of more than two days, the
student should apply for and take a leave of absence. Penalty for students' whose
attendance falls below a threshold will be as decided by Senate from time to time, and
communicated to students.
(2) A student may be allowed to take semester leave, with permission before the last date of
add/drop, for any valid reason, as determined by AAC, including but not limited to ill
health, internships, entrepreneurship, family requirements, etc. No semester leave will be
granted after the last date of add/drop other than for the critical reasons such as ill health
(In such cases, no fee refund is admissible if the student has registered for the semester
which is converted to the semester leave later.) A student shall not be permitted more than
four semester leaves in the entire program. Any circumstance leading to more than four
semester leave/drop may result in the automatic termination of the program. This implies
that a student has to necessarily be registered and physically be present on campus for 8
15
semesters during his/her degree program except during the last semester when a student
can go for internship, provided he satisfies the eligibility criteria to go for internship.
(3) If a student is absent from the Institute for more than 20 days in a semester due to medical
or any other reason, this may be converted to a semester leave for that semester by DOAA.
However, if a student represents IIIT-Delhi in some event, with prior permission of Dean
of Students Affairs, absence due to this participation will not be counted.
7.5 Appeals
A student, whose program has been terminated, may appeal against the decision. All such
appeals shall be made to the Senate within two weeks, and the decision of the Academic
Senate shall be final. Other academics related appeals may be made to AAC.
7.6 Branch Transfer
Transfer of B.Tech. students from one program to the other is possible only after the
grades of the first semester are out. This is the only time branch change will occur. A
student must make an explicit request to be considered for program transfer within a week
from the date of announcement of results of the first semester. In his/her request, the
student can mention more than one program in the order of preference. Rules for program
transfer are:
1.
Only the students who satisfy eligibility for a particular branch at the time of admission are
eligible for transfer to that branch.
2.
Students admitted through AICTE need to produce NOC from AICTE if applying for
transfer to another program.
3.
Students must have passed all credits specified for the first semester of the B.Tech.
program.
4.
To be eligible for transfer to Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Computer Science
and Applied Mathematics (CSAM) or Computer Science and Design (CSD) program or
Computer Science and Social Sciences (CSSS) program or Computer Science and
Biosciences (CSB) program or Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAI)
program, a student must have received a B or better grade in Introduction to Programming
(IP) and Mathematics-I.
5.
To be eligible for transfer to Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) program,
a student must have received a B or better grade in both Digital Circuits and Mathematics-
I.
Students eligible for program transfer will be ordered in a priority list based on CGPA and
will be granted transfer in order as long as the strength of each program does not violate the
following limits.
16
6.
The base strength of a program for a batch will be the number of students who were admitted
and who are still enrolled in the program as on Dec 15 (after Sem 1) after completion of one
semester, not counting those who were repeating the first year. (E.g. Suppose 110 students
were admitted in a batch and there were 8 repeaters. If 6 of the admitted students dropped
out before Dec 15, then the base strength will be 110-6=104). The final strength of any
program shall not reduce by more than 10% of its base strength. Also, the final strength of
any program shall not increase by more than 10% of its base strength.

Repeaters who are repeating first year are also allowed branch transfer under the above-
mentioned rules.

In case of a tie in CGPA of students, below tie breaking rules will be followed for
deciding transfer from one branch to another
Tie Breaking Rule I - For transfer to CSE, CSAM, CSD, CSSS and CSB branches, higher
grade in the order of Introduction to Programming, Maths-I, System Management, Digital
Circuits, Communication Skills
Tie Breaking Rule II -Higher JEE Rank
7.7 Migration to Dual Degree Program
A B.Tech. student can opt to migrate to dual degree program of the institute immediately
after the declaration of Semester 6 Results. A student once selected for Dual Degree may
opt out from migration before the add/drop date of his/her 7th semester in the B.Tech.
program provided he/she has not availed the Placement Service. Eligibility criteria and
regulations for the dual degree program are given separately.
8

Degree to such students will be awarded in next Convocation and the scroll of such students
may be signed by the Chairman, BoG.
8.7 Prizes and Medals
The academic senate of the institute will set up awards, prizes, medals etc. to be given to
deserving students during their B.Tech degree including awards distributed at the time of
Convocation. All approved student awards and prizes are listed along with their selection
criteria in the "Awards Regulations"
Under exceptional circumstances, where gross violation of the conditions of the
awards/recognition or academic misconduct is detected at a later stage, the Senate may
recommend to the Board of Governors to withdraw the award and recognition.
9
Disciplinary Action
IIIT-Delhi maintains global academic standards in its own education system. Therefore, it
does not tolerate any form of indiscipline/ academic dishonesty. Action will be taken against
students found engaging in acts of indiscipline/ academic dishonesty by the Disciplinary
Action Committee (DAC), constituted by the Director. The disciplinary action may result in
semester/year/two year drop or even expulsion from the Institute. Separate rules and
regulations have been formulated to handle the cases of violations.

REGULATIONS FOR B.TECH. PROGRAMS
1
General
(1) This document gives the general regulations applicable to all B.Tech. programs. Specific
requirements for a particular B.Tech. program (e.g. B.Tech. in Computer Science and
Engineering) are specified in regulations for that program.
(2) While the Senate is the main statutory body for all academic matters, the Undergraduate
Committee (UGC), a standing committee of Senate, shall oversee matters related to the
undergraduate programs. This committee shall be appointed by the Senate and shall have
a term of two years. It will consist of Faculty members and members of the Senate. In
addition, there will be at least one student representative, who will be a full time UG
student of the Institute.
(3) Any condition arising in the B.Tech. program and not covered in the regulations shall be
referred to the UG committee which may refer it to the Senate.
(4) Dean of Academic Affairs (DOAA) is the main functionary who ensures the smooth
functioning of the academic programs as approved by the academic Senate, executes the
policies and decisions of the Senate and UGC and PGC. DOAA's office receives,
processes and maintains all records relating to the undergraduate programs including
curricula, courses offered, academic calendar, registration, leave, examinations, grades
and award of degrees and prizes; disseminates information and issues orders pertaining to
all academic matters; processes requests from students regarding academic matters.
2
Academic Session and Calendar
 There are two regular semesters and one summer term in a year. Most courses are
taught in the regular semesters. The semester timeline shall be defined in the
academic calendar and will be broadly the following.
a) Semester I (Monsoon Semester). Starts around August 1 and ends around the
last week of November.
b) Semester II (Winter Semester). Starts around January 2 and ends around the last
week of April.
c) Summer Term. Starts around the middle of May and ends around the middle of
July.
 A semester is of about four months in duration with 13 weeks of teaching, a mid-
semester recess, a mid-semester examination, and an end-semester examination.
Generally the last 10 days in the semester are reserved for the end-semester
3
examination, presentations, demos, etc. The summer term is about half the
duration of the regular semesters, and the courses taught run at a faster pace to
complete in duration of the summer term.
 The academic calendar, published every year/semester, specifies the dates for
major academic activities like registration, examinations, mid-semester recess,
etc., will be prepared and published by DOAA, and tabled in the Senate.

Admission
 Number of Seats
The total number of seats will be as decided by the Board of Governors and will
be announced every year in the admission prospectus. No change in the total
number of seats will be done after the merit list for admission has been
announced. The Board may also decide to have a special supernumerary quota for
foreign students.
 Admission Criteria
Admission to the undergraduate program at IIIT-Delhi is based on criteria which
use scores from entrance test(s), class XII, and other competitions. Details about
the admission criteria and entrance test(s) whose scores are to be used, are
announced through the admission prospectus each year. The minimum eligibility
criteria for applying is that a candidate must have secured 80 percent or more
marks in the aggregate and 80% or more in Mathematics in class XII from
CBSE/ICSE/IB board or equivalent is eligible for applying to IIIT-Delhi.
Relaxation is given for category students, as specified in the prospectus.
Additional requirements for minimum eligibility for specific programs are also as
specified in the prospectus. Candidates whose program had been terminated at
any other university/institute on disciplinary grounds are not eligible for
admission at IIIT-Delhi.
 Reservations
The current reservation policy (decided by the Board of Governors) of the
Institute largely reflects the policy of Delhi Government. Currently, 85% of the
seats are reserved for Delhi candidates (i.e. those who have completed class XII
from a school/college/institute located in Delhi), and 15% for outside Delhi
candidates. Category-wise reservation is provided within these limits, as
explained in the prospectus for each year.
 Offer of Admission
(1) During counseling, based on the merit list, a candidate will be invited to join the
institute. A candidate will be admitted if he/she
4
a) presents all original documents for verification of the information provided in the
admission form
b) pays the required fee, and
c) completes the admission formalities.
(2) Those candidates unable to show the proof of fulfilling the eligibility criteria may
be given a provisional admission subject to their presenting such a proof by the
following September 30th.
 Cancellation of Admission
(1) The admission of a candidate to the undergraduate program may be cancelled if
any material information provided is found to be incorrect, he/she does not pay
the fee by the given date, or does not report on the announced day for registration.
The Institute reserves the right to extend the date of reporting and date of
depositing fee if a case is found to be genuine.
(2) The admission of a student may be cancelled by the Senate even at a later date if
it is found that the student had supplied some false information or suppressed any
relevant information while seeking admission.
 Foreign Students
Some seats may be reserved for foreign students. These are usually
supernumerary, and admission for such seats is handled separately. The number
of seats and the process for application and admission are described in each year's
prospectus.
 Non-degree Students
A non-degree student is a student registered for a degree in a recognized
university/ institute in India or abroad and who is officially sponsored by that
Institute/university to complete part of the academic requirements at IIIT-Delhi.
Such students may do courses or projects in IIIT-Delhi, and will be given
transcripts for the academic work carried out at IIIT-Delhi. During their stay at
IIIT-Delhi, such students will also be governed by all academic and disciplinary
rules of IIIT-Delhi. Credits earned by a non-degree student at IIIT-Delhi cannot
be applied towards any degree/diploma offered by IIIT-Delhi at any time. The
admission to non-degree status is decided on a case to case basis. The applications
are received by the DOAA.
5
4
Courses and Credits
(1) Every semester the Institute offers some courses, taught by faculty appointed by it.
(2) A course may be of 4, 2, or 1 credit. A registered student who passes a course earns the
credits assigned for that course.
a) A 4-credit course. The course will have 3 hours of lectures per week, with a total
of about 39 hours of lectures (13 weeks). In addition, one hour of interaction per
week is expected, which may be in form of structured tutorials. There may also be
labs in the course.
b) A 2-credit course. The course will have 1.5 hours of lectures per week for the
whole semester, or 3 hours of lectures per week for half the semester. The total
lectures hours will be about 20. Intensive short-term courses of 2 credits are also
possible, though it is expected that the duration of such a course will be no less than
3 weeks. A 2-credit course may or may not have tutorials and labs.
c) A 1-credit course. The course is likely to be run as a short course on a very
specialized topic. Such courses may also be run during vacations. A 1-credit course
will have a total of about 10 hours of lecture over a period of, generally, not less
than 2 weeks.
d) Certain courses such as Self-Growth (SG), Community Work (CW), may be taken
for varying number of credits on case to case basis.
(3) While taking courses in the Institute is the primary means for a student to earn credits,
there may be other approved provisions for earning credit through projects, studying in
other Institutions and transferring credits, etc. Such provisions will be provided in these
or other regulations.
(4) Online Courses
IIIT-Delhi has evolved a system for allowing students to take online courses. Students
can take advantage of the increasing amount of such courses made available by reputed
universities across the world to complement the courses offered in the institute.
1. A B.Tech. student is allowed to register for online courses (OC) as regular courses
(and not in the category of Independent Project (IP)/Independent Study
(IS)/Undergraduate Research (UR)/B.Tech. Project (BTP)).
2. The limit "one course in a semester" for OC means that "no more than 4 credits of
OC can be taken in a semester".
3. A student can take upto 8 credits of Online Courses in his B.Tech. degree.
6
5
Registration
(1) At the beginning of each semester, a student shall register for the courses he/she wishes
to take in that semester. A student shall normally be allowed to register for a course
only if he/she has passed all the necessary pre-requisites for that course.
(2) Registration is compulsory for all students who are not on leave of absence, and is the
sole responsibility of the student and must be completed before the last date of
registration. Failure to register may lead to termination of the student for that semester.
5.1 Registration Procedure
(1) Registration will generally be done just before the start of classes in a semester. Pre-
registration for a semester can be done toward the end of the previous semester. Students
will be informed about these dates and other details every semester.
(2) Registration process has two parts: academic and administrative, and both of these must
be completed in order to complete the registration process. Academic registration includes
specifying the courses that the student wishes to do in the semester and getting the
necessary approvals. Students can seek advice from Advisors nominated for the purpose by
the DOAA. Administrative part includes paying all dues to the Institute.
5.2 Late Registration
Late registration is permitted as per academic calendar on the payment of late registration
fee. The late fee may be waived if the delay is due to an academic activity undertaken with
prior permission. The number of days missed due to late arrival shall be treated as leave of
absence. A fee for late academic registration may be imposed.
5.3 Pre-registration of Courses
Pre-registration is necessary part of the academic registration for non-first semester
students. In case a student fails to do pre-registration of courses, a penalty may be imposed
if the student does not register his/her preference within the stipulated period.
5.4 Adding or Dropping of Courses
A student can change the courses that he/she does in a semester by adding and dropping
courses till the last date for add/drop as specified in the academic calendar. In addition, a
student can withdraw from at most one elective course up to the last date specified in the
academic calendar, which will normally be after the mid-semester examination. During the
summer term, a student may be permitted to drop one course by the late drop date.
7
5.5 Registration of Students with Backlog Course(s)
A student has a backlog if he/she has not taken or has taken but failed in course(s) of
previous semester(s). The registration of such a student must be approved by the DOAA
who will advise the student. Generally, the student should register in a manner that he/she
can clear as many backlog courses as are available.
5.6 Cancellation of registration
A student is solely responsible to ensure that all conditions for proper registration are
satisfied, and there are no timetable clashes. The registration may be cancelled by the
DOAA for a course if any irregularity is found at a later stage. A student's registration for
the semester may be cancelled as part of disciplinary action. Leave beyond permissible
limits may also result in cancellation of registration for a semester.
5.7 Summer term registration
Registering in the summer term is optional. A student may register for up to 6 credits of
courses that are offered during the summer term (inclusive of SG/CW credits). Out of these
6 credits, for students who have completed the 2nd year of their B.Tech. program, may be
allowed to take up to 4 credits for IP/IS/UR/BTP. An exception may be made for the
students of the graduating batch, who may be allowed to take up to 8 credits. The
registration shall be done just before the start of the term. There will not be any late
registration in the summer term and a student shall not be allowed to add a course after
registration.
5.8 Academic Load
In general, students will take courses as per the program. Normal load for the first and
second year students is 16-20 credits and for the third and fourth year students is 16-22
credits.
When a student registers for more credits than the stipulated normal load, it is called the
overload. First year students cannot take any overload. Second year students having a
CGPA of more than 8.0 can take an overload of up to 2 additional credits over 20 credits.
Third and fourth year students having a CGPA of more than 8.0 can take an overload of up
to 2 additional credits over 22 credits.
When the student registers for less than 16 credits in a semester, it is called the underload.
A student may be allowed, with permission of the DOAA an underload of a maximum of 4
credits below 16 credits.
Students under academic warning may not be permitted any overload. Such students may
be advised by DOAA to take an underload.
Students can avail underload below 12 credits (as low as 4 credits) only in one semester
during their entire B.Tech. program. For this, prior permission is required to be taken
8
before the last date of add/drop of that particular semester. Students wanting to avail
internship (industrial, academic, research, etc.) without taking semester leave can do so
with prior approval of the DOAA in only one semester of their degree program. Such
request needs to be placed at least two days before the last date of add/drop. Students
approved for such internship are required to register for 4 credits of only
IP/IS/UR/BTP/OC courses in this semester. Students will not be allowed to do any in-class
course during the internship period. Further, the underload of as low as 4 credits can be
availed by ECE, CSAM and CSSS students in any semester of the 3rd and 4th year, while
CSE, CSD and CSB students can do so only in the 8th Semester.
6
Teaching and Evaluation
6.1 Teaching
Each course is conducted by the Instructor-in-charge with the assistance of tutors and/or
teaching assistants. The Instructor-in-charge is responsible for conducting the lectures,
tutorials, and labs, holding the tests and examinations, evaluating the performance of the
students, awarding grades at the end of the semester/summer term, and transmitting the
grades to the DOAA's office within the prescribed time limit.
6.2 Continuous Evaluation System
(1) The Institute follows a system of continuous evaluation, in which, during a course,
various instruments like tests, exams, assignments, projects, etc., are given by the
instructor to assess the learning of students and assign grades. All evaluations are the
responsibility of the instructor in-charge of the course. The two main exams - the mid-
semester exam and the end-semester exam - shall normally be scheduled as per the
academic calendar while the schedule of the rest will be decided by the Instructor. For 1
or 2 credit courses, the Instructor will decide the evaluation criteria and the schedule of
tests and exams.
(2) Make-up Exam: If a student, for valid reasons such as illness, etc., fails to appear in the
end-semester examination in one or more course(s), he/she may make a request to the
instructor and the academic office for a make-up examination within two days of the date
of the scheduled examination. Such a request must, however, be supported by proper
documentary evidence for justifying the request. For medical reasons, only two medical
applications including mid-semester and end-semester would be accepted for make-up
examinations during the entire duration of the B.Tech. degree completion. Further, for the
grant of medical leave, students are required to upload the medical certificate within five
working days from the date of the missed examination. The Institute reserves the right to
get the medical certificate verified from the Institute Doctor. Finally, the request for
make-up examination will be approved by the DOAA.
9
6.3 Grading Scheme
(1) One of the letter grades given in the following table shall be awarded to a student
reflecting his/her overall performance in a course. Each letter grade carries certain points
as given in the table, and these points are used in the computation of the SGPA/CGPA as
explained later.
Letter Grade
Grade
Points
Remarks
A+ (Outstanding)
10
Letter grades A+ to F and I are given only in the
regular courses.
This grading scheme is effectively A to F. A+ grade
is only to recognize excellent performers in a
course, though it has the same grade points as an A
grade.
A (Very Good)
10
A(-)
9
B (Good)
8
B(-)
7
C (Satisfactory)
6
C(-)
5
D (Marginal)
4
F (Fail)
2
F Grade is not counted in the calculation of CGPA,
however, it is counted in the calculation of SGPA.
I (Incomplete)
Nil
Incomplete (I grade) must be converted to one of
the letter grades (A to F) as per the academic
calendar
W(Withdrawn)
Nil
"W" grade shall be printed in the transcript of the
students who do ‘Late Drop'
S (Satisfactory)
Nil
S and X are grades for only certain kinds of courses
like Audit course. They are not incorporated in
SGPA/CGPA calculation.
X (Unsatisfactory)
Nil
(2) In the academic courses, the final grades awarded are A to F (A+ is a grade with same
points as A, and is there to honor excellence).
(3) An I (Incomplete) grade may be awarded in cases when all the requirements for a course
are not met by the student at the time of submission of grades and it essentially reflects as
an "incomplete" status in the Evaluation Resource Planning (ERP) system. For all
courses including project-based courses, this grade must be converted to a regular grade
within one month of the end of the current term (i.e., the moderation date). For courses
other than project / independent study, incomplete grade "I" is meant primarily for
medical reasons. All unconverted "I" grades are automatically converted to F grade after
the grade conversion deadline, which is one month after the moderation date.
(4) In certain courses, such as Online Courses (OC, Self-Growth (SG and Community Work
(CW courses, only S or X grade is awarded.
(5) The F and X grades are "fail" grades and the student shall be required to repeat the
course. If the course is a compulsory course, the student shall repeat the same course in
10
another semester/summer when the course is offered. In the case of an elective/optional
course, the student can replace the course by another elective course.
(6) For at most one compulsory (core) course, after getting an F twice in the course, a student
may be allowed to replace it by an elective course of the respective discipline with the
prior approval from DOAA.
(7) An F and X grade obtained in any course shall be reflected in the grade sheet. However,
when the course is replaced or repeated, the new grade will be used for computation of
the CGPA. The pass grade for the respective course will count towards the SGPA of the
semester in which the course is passed and not in the semester where ‘F' grade was
awarded. ‘F' grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, although it is
counted in the calculation of SGPA.
6.4
Change of Grade Already Awarded
As mentioned in Ordinances, a letter grade, once awarded, shall not be changed unless
the request is made by the Instructor-in-Charge of the course and is approved by the
Chairman, Senate. Any such request for change of grade must, however, be made within
four weeks of the start of the next semester with all relevant records and justification.
6.5
(i) Grade Improvement
For some important core courses, refresher modules may be offered during vacations for
students' benefit. Based on their performance in the refresher module, only students with
F or D grade may be allowed at most half the letter grade improvement (i.e.
improvement from F to D or D to C- -), although any student can attend. Decision
regarding whether these modules are to be offered during vacation and whether they may
be used for grade enhancement will be taken every year. As with a grade change, this
grade improvement will be approved and authorized by Chairman, Senate.
(ii) UG students to repeat (Improvement) of a particular course
Repeat of a course completed with pass grade may be allowed, but only the best Grade
in that course will be counted for CGPA computation. Also, all attempts in that course
will be recorded in the respective semesters' transcripts and the repeat course will not be
permitted for late drop after mid-semester examination. For repeating a course, a student
has to simply register on ERP during the course registration period.
6.6 Performance Indicators
(1) The semester performance is indicated by a Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)
which is a weighted sum of all the points earned in the courses done in a semester. The
SGPA is given for each semester and is computed using the following formula.
11
SGPA = (u1.w1 + u2.w2 + … + un.wn) / (u1 + u2 + … + un)
where ui is the number of credits for the course i and wi is the points earned through the
letter grade in that course, and n is the number of courses taken in the semester. While
doing the computation of SGPA, the course/thesis credits with grades S and X are
ignored.
(2) The overall performance is indicated by a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)
which is computed in the same manner as the computation of SGPA but for all the
courses done in the program.
‘F' grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, however, it is counted in the
calculation of SGPA.
(3) The grades in courses will be announced over ERP at the end of every semester. A grade
report for the semester may be issued to a student after the semester upon request. The
grade report may be withheld if the student has not paid the fees or other dues, has a
disciplinary case pending against him/her, has not completed other formalities, or for any
other pertinent reason.
6.7 Transfer of Credits
Students may be permitted to do academic work and courses in places of repute outside
IIIT-Delhi and may be allowed to spend up to 2 semesters at another University. The
maximum credit transfer allowed is 40 credits over the entire B.Tech. program (with a
maximum of 20 credits in a semester). Based on their performance/quantum of work
done and the contents of the course/work, some credits may be transferred for similar
courses/projects. Institutions with which IIIT-Delhi has arrangements/MOU/student
exchange programs, transfer of credits may also be permitted. This transfer of credits will
be approved on a case-by-case basis by the DOAA and will be reported to the Senate.
6.8
B.Tech. students are allowed to do "extra credits" beyond 156 credits
 B.Tech. students are allowed to do "extra credits" beyond 156 credits required for
completion of B.Tech. requirement. For N extra credits done, the student will be
allowed worst grades in N credits, with a maximum limit of at most 8 credits, to
be not counted towards CGPA computation. The impact of this decision will be
reviewed after two batches have graduated with this option. Following method
will be used for calculating the CGPA:
Method: The below method will automatically decide which extra credits will not
be counted in CGPA:
 For CGPA computation at the end of 6th semester, baseline credits will be 116
(equal to 29 full courses including OC but excluding SG & CW). If a student has done
N credits more than 116, then for CGPA computation the following will be done:
- The worst grades in courses totaling M credits will be "removed", where M=
12
min{8, N}.
- CGPA will be computed based on the remaining credits. It is to be noted that since
OC's are with S/X Grades, although they will be included in baseline 116 credits, they
will not be counted in CGPA. For example, if a student has done 120 credits including
OC of 4 credits, CGPA will be computed from best grades corresponding to 112
credits.
 For CGPA computation at the end of 7th semester, baseline credits will be 136
(including OC but excluding SG & CW).
 CGPA computation for Honors students at the end of 8th semester will done
similar to a non-Honors student, i.e., he will be allowed to not-count worst grades
of courses up to 8 credits. For example, if a student has done 164 credits
(excluding SG/CW credits) including OC of 4 credits, CGPA will be computed
from best grades corresponding to 152 credits.
General Rules:
 SGPA computation will remain the same for each semester.
 CGPA computation will remain the same for first 5 semesters, even if a student
has done "extra credits."
6.9 B.Tech. student, who has already completed his/her graduation requirement (including
registration for a minimum of 8 semesters on campus), will be allowed to register for at
most two extra courses to improve his/her CGPA. Registration after completion of 156
credits, required for graduation, will be allowed in only one extra semester. Further,
registration of extra credits will be permitted provided he/she pays fees for that extra
semester. Moreover, such students will not be considered for any award/medal.
7
Continuing in the Program
For continuing in the undergraduate program, the student has to show satisfactory academic
performance as may be defined by the Senate from time to time. If the academic
performance falls short, a student may be asked to repeat the first year, placed under
warning, or his/her program may be terminated.
7.1 Rules for the first year (excluding the summer term scheduled after the first year)
(1) A student will be put on probation at the end of the first semester, if he/she passes 2
or less technical courses (courses other than Communication Skills) in the first
13
semester. For details about department wise technical and non-technical courses of
first year, refer program-wise regulations.
(2) If a student passes 3 or less technical courses in the entire first year provided he/she
did not take semester leave in any of the two semester, his/her program will be
terminated.
If a student passes 3 or less technical courses in the entire first year and was on leave
in either of the two semesters, he will have to repeat the first year, i.e., he/she has to
do first semester in the next academic year and will not be allowed to continue with
the third semester.
(3) If a student passes 4 or 5 technical courses in the entire first year, he/she will have to
repeat the year. Further, if a student passes 3 or less technical courses in the first
semester, he/she will be allowed to take semester leave in the Semester 2 or can
continue in Semester 2. However, in both the cases, he has to follow rule 2 mentioned
above.
(4) If a student repeating the first year fails in more than 1 technical courses in either
semester of the repeat year, his/her program will be terminated.
(5) A student repeating the first year may be allowed transfer of credits only for the non-
technical courses that he/she had passed in his/her previous attempt.
Regular rules for backlog will apply for any courses he/she may have failed.
7.2 Academic Warning/Probation
A student shall be placed under academic warning/probation on the grounds of
inadequate academic performance for one (subsequent) semester
(1) If he/she fails in any course in a semester
(2) If he/she gets an SGPA of 4.5 or less in a semester, or has a CGPA of 4.5 or less at
the end of the semester.
The following will apply to a student who is placed on a warning (academic as well as
warning due to disciplinary reasons):
(1) The student will not be allowed to hold any elected or nominated post for any
institute body including the hostel management, students' activities, and student
council.
(2) The student will not be allowed to participate in any event outside the Institute as
member of the Institute team.
14
(3) No academic overload shall be permitted to such students.
(4) The students may be required by the DOAA to take an underload.
(5) The student will be required to sign an undertaking to agree and follow all stipulated
conditions of warning. All such undertakings shall be countersigned by the
parent/guardian of the student.
7.3 Rules for promotion to next semester for 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students.
If a student gets academic warning because of low SGPA (of <4.0) in two consecutive
semesters and/or gets two or more F grades each in two consecutive semesters, his/her
program will be terminated.
7.4 Attendance and Leave of Absence
(1) A student is expected to attend all classes. For any absence of more than two days, the
student should apply for and take a leave of absence. Penalty for students' whose
attendance falls below a threshold will be as decided by Senate from time to time, and
communicated to students.
(2) A student may be allowed to take semester leave, with permission before the last date of
add/drop, for any valid reason, as determined by UGC, including but not limited to ill
health, internships, entrepreneurship, family requirements, etc. No semester leave will be
granted after the last date of add/drop other than for the critical reasons such as ill health
(In such cases, no fee refund is admissible if the student has registered for the semester
which is converted to the semester leave later.) A student shall not be permitted more
than four semester leaves in the entire program. Any circumstance leading to more than
four semester leave/drop may result in the automatic termination of the program. This
implies that a student has to necessarily be registered and physically be present on
campus for 8 semesters during his/her degree program.
(3) If a student is absent from the Institute for more than 20 days in a semester due to
medical or any other reason, this may be converted to a semester leave for that semester
by DOAA. However, if a student represents IIIT-Delhi in some event, with prior
permission of Dean of Students Affairs, absence due to this participation will not be
counted.
7.5 Appeals
A student, whose program has been terminated, may appeal against the decision. All such
appeals shall be made to the Senate within two weeks, and the decision of the Academic
Senate shall be final. Other academics related appeals may be made to UGC.
15
7.6 Branch Transfer
Transfer of B.Tech. students from one program to the other is possible only after the
grades of the first semester are out. This is the only time branch change will occur. A
student must make an explicit request to be considered for program transfer within in a
week from the date of announcement of results of the first semester. In his/her request, the
student can mention more than one program in the order of preference. Rules for program
transfer are:
1.
Only the students who satisfy eligibility for a particular branch at the time of admission
are eligible for transfer to that branch.
2.
Students admitted through AICTE need to produce NOC from AICTE if applying for
transfer to another program.
3.
Students must have passed all credits specified for the first semester of the B.Tech.
program.
4.
To be eligible for transfer to Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Computer Science
and Applied Mathematics (CSAM) or Computer Science and Design (CSD) program or
Computer Science and Social Sciences (CSSS) program or Computer Science and
Biosciences (CSB) program, a student must have received a B or better grade in
Introduction to Programming (IP) and Mathematics-I.
5.
To be eligible for transfer to Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) program,
a student must have received a B or better grade in both Digital Circuits and Mathematics-
I.
Students eligible for program transfer will be ordered in a priority list based on CGPA and
will be granted transfer in order as long as the strength of each program does not violate the
following limits.
6.
The base strength of a program for a batch will be the number of students who were
admitted and who are still enrolled in the program as on Dec 15 (after Sem 1) after
completion of one semester, not counting those who were repeating the first year. (E.g.
Suppose 110 students were admitted in a batch and there were 8 repeaters. If 6 of the
admitted students dropped out before Dec 15, then the base strength will be 110-6=104).
The final strength of any program shall not reduce by more than 10% of its base strength.
Also, the final strength of any program shall not increase by more than 10% of its base
strength.
 Repeaters who are repeating first year are also allowed branch transfer under the
above-mentioned rules.
 In case of a tie in CGPA of students, below tie breaking rules will be followed for
deciding transfer from one branch to another
16
Tie Breaking Rule I - For transfer to CSE, CSAM, CSD, CSSS and CSB branches, higher
grade in the order of Introduction to Programming, Maths-I, System Management, Digital
Circuits, Communication Skills
Tie Breaking Rule II -Higher JEE Rank
7.7 Migration to Dual Degree Program
A B.Tech. student can opt to migrate to dual degree program of the institute immediately

General
(1) This document gives the general regulations applicable to all B.Tech. programs. Specific
requirements for a particular B.Tech. program (e.g. B.Tech. in Computer Science and
Engineering) are specified in regulations for that program.
(2) While the Senate is the main statutory body for all academic matters, the Undergraduate
Committee (UGC), a standing committee of Senate, shall oversee matters related to the
undergraduate programs. This committee shall be appointed by the Senate and shall have
a term of two years. It will consist of Faculty members and members of the Senate. In
addition, there will be at least one student representative, who will be a full time UG
student of the Institute.
(3) Any condition arising in the B.Tech. program and not covered in the regulations shall be
referred to the UG committee which may refer it to the Senate.
(4) Dean of Academic Affairs (DOAA) is the main functionary who ensures the smooth
functioning of the academic programs as approved by the academic Senate, executes the
policies and decisions of the Senate and UGC and PGC. DOAA's office receives,
processes and maintains all records relating to the undergraduate programs including
curricula, courses offered, academic calendar, registration, leave, examinations, grades
and award of degrees and prizes; disseminates information and issues orders pertaining to
all academic matters; processes requests from students regarding academic matters.
2
Academic Session and Calendar
 There are two regular semesters and one summer term in a year. Most courses are
taught in the regular semesters. The semester timeline shall be defined in the
academic calendar and will be broadly the following.
a) Semester I (Monsoon Semester). Starts around August 1 and ends around the
last week of November.
b) Semester II (Winter Semester). Starts around January 2 and ends around the last
week of April.
c) Summer Term. Starts around the middle of May and ends around the middle of
July.
 A semester is of about four months in duration with 13 weeks of teaching, a mid-
semester recess, a mid-semester examination, and an end-semester examination.
Generally the last 10 days in the semester are reserved for the end-semester
3
examination, presentations, demos, etc. The summer term is about half the
duration of the regular semesters, and the courses taught run at a faster pace to
complete in duration of the summer term.
 The academic calendar, published every year/semester, specifies the dates for
major academic activities like registration, examinations, mid-semester recess,
etc., will be prepared and published by DOAA, and tabled in the Senate.
3
Admission
 Number of Seats
The total number of seats will be as decided by the Board of Governors and will
be announced every year in the admission prospectus. No change in the total
number of seats will be done after the merit list for admission has been
announced. The Board may also decide to have a special supernumerary quota for
foreign students.
 Admission Criteria
Admission to the undergraduate program at IIIT-Delhi is based on criteria which
use scores from entrance test(s), class XII, and other competitions. Details about
the admission criteria and entrance test(s) whose scores are to be used, are

Additional requirements for minimum eligibility for specific programs are also as
specified in the prospectus. Candidates whose program had been terminated at
any other university/institute on disciplinary grounds are not eligible for
admission at IIIT-Delhi.
 Reservations
The current reservation policy (decided by the Board of Governors) of the
Institute largely reflects the policy of Delhi Government. Currently, 85% of the
seats are reserved for Delhi candidates (i.e. those who have completed class XII
from a school/college/institute located in Delhi), and 15% for outside Delhi
candidates. Category-wise reservation is provided within these limits, as
explained in the prospectus for each year.
 Offer of Admission
(1) During counseling, based on the merit list, a candidate will be invited to join the
institute. A candidate will be admitted if he/she
4
a) presents all original documents for verification of the information provided in the
admission form
b) pays the required fee, and

be given a provisional admission subject to their presenting such a proof by the
following September 30th.
 Cancellation of Admission
(1) The admission of a candidate to the undergraduate program may be cancelled if
any material information provided is found to be incorrect, he/she does not pay
the fee by the given date, or does not report on the announced day for registration.
The Institute reserves the right to extend the date of reporting and date of
depositing fee if a case is found to be genuine.
(2) The admission of a student may be cancelled by the Senate even at a later date if
it is found that the student had supplied some false information or suppressed any
relevant information while seeking admission.
 Foreign Students
Some seats may be reserved for foreign students. These are usually
supernumerary, and admission for such seats is handled separately. The number
of seats and the process for application and admission are described in each year's
prospectus.
 Non-degree Students
A non-degree student is a student registered for a degree in a recognized
university/ institute in India or abroad and who is officially sponsored by that
Institute/university to complete part of the academic requirements at IIIT-Delhi.
Such students may do courses or projects in IIIT-Delhi, and will be given
transcripts for the academic work carried out at IIIT-Delhi. During their stay at
IIIT-Delhi, such students will also be governed by all academic and disciplinary
rules of IIIT-Delhi. Credits earned by a non-degree student at IIIT-Delhi cannot
be applied towards any degree/diploma offered by IIIT-Delhi at any time. The
admission to non-degree status is decided on a case to case basis. The applications
are received by the DOAA.
5
4
Courses and Credits
(1) Every semester the Institute offers some courses, taught by faculty appointed by it.
(2) A course may be of 4, 2, or 1 credit. A registered student who passes a course earns the
credits assigned for that course.
a) A 4-credit course. The course will have 3 hours of lectures per week, with a total
of about 39 hours of lectures (13 weeks). In addition, one hour of interaction per
week is expected, which may be in form of structured tutorials. There may also be
labs in the course.
b) A 2-credit course. The course will have 1.5 hours of lectures per week for the
whole semester, or 3 hours of lectures per week for half the semester. The total
lectures hours will be about 20. Intensive short-term courses of 2 credits are also
possible, though it is expected that the duration of such a course will be no less than
3 weeks. A 2-credit course may or may not have tutorials and labs.
c) A 1-credit course. The course is likely to be run as a short course on a very
specialized topic. Such courses may also be run during vacations. A 1-credit course
will have a total of about 10 hours of lecture over a period of, generally, not less
than 2 weeks.
d) Certain courses such as Self-Growth (SG), Community Work (CW), may be taken
for varying number of credits on case to case basis.
(3) While taking courses in the Institute is the primary means for a student to earn credits,
there may be other approved provisions for earning credit through projects, studying in
other Institutions and transferring credits, etc. Such provisions will be provided in these
or other regulations.
(4) Online Courses
IIIT-Delhi has evolved a system for allowing students to take online courses. Students
can take advantage of the increasing amount of such courses made available by reputed
universities across the world to complement the courses offered in the institute.
1. A B.Tech. student is allowed to register for online courses (OC) as regular courses
(and not in the category of Independent Project (IP)/Independent Study
(IS)/Undergraduate Research (UR)/B.Tech. Project (BTP)).
2. The limit "one course in a semester" for OC means that "no more than 4 credits of
OC can be taken in a semester".
3. A student can take upto 8 credits of Online Courses in his B.Tech. degree.
6
5
Registration
(1) At the beginning of each semester, a student shall register for the courses he/she wishes
to take in that semester. A student shall normally be allowed to register for a course
only if he/she has passed all the necessary pre-requisites for that course.
(2) Registration is compulsory for all students who are not on leave of absence, and is the
sole responsibility of the student and must be completed before the last date of
registration. Failure to register may lead to termination of the student for that semester.
5.1 Registration Procedure
(1) Registration will generally be done just before the start of classes in a semester. Pre-
registration for a semester can be done toward the end of the previous semester. Students
will be informed about these dates and other details every semester.
(2) Registration process has two parts: academic and administrative, and both of these must
be completed in order to complete the registration process. Academic registration includes
specifying the courses that the student wishes to do in the semester and getting the
necessary approvals. Students can seek advice from Advisors nominated for the purpose by
the DOAA. Administrative part includes paying all dues to the Institute.
5.2 Late Registration
Late registration is permitted as per academic calendar on the payment of late registration
fee. The late fee may be waived if the delay is due to an academic activity undertaken with
prior permission. The number of days missed due to late arrival shall be treated as leave of
absence. A fee for late academic registration may be imposed.
5.3 Pre-registration of Courses
Pre-registration is necessary part of the academic registration for non-first semester
students. In case a student fails to do pre-registration of courses, a penalty may be imposed
if the student does not register his/her preference within the stipulated period.
5.4 Adding or Dropping of Courses
A student can change the courses that he/she does in a semester by adding and dropping
courses till the last date for add/drop as specified in the academic calendar. In addition, a
student can withdraw from at most one elective course up to the last date specified in the
academic calendar, which will normally be after the mid-semester examination. During the
summer term, a student may be permitted to drop one course by the late drop date.
7
5.5 Registration of Students with Backlog Course(s)
A student has a backlog if he/she has not taken or has taken but failed in course(s) of
previous semester(s). The registration of such a student must be approved by the DOAA
who will advise the student. Generally, the student should register in a manner that he/she
can clear as many backlog courses as are available.
5.6 Cancellation of registration
A student is solely responsible to ensure that all conditions for proper registration are
satisfied, and there are no timetable clashes. The registration may be cancelled by the
DOAA for a course if any irregularity is found at a later stage. A student's registration for
the semester may be cancelled as part of disciplinary action. Leave beyond permissible
limits may also result in cancellation of registration for a semester.
5.7 Summer term registration
Registering in the summer term is optional. A student may register for up to 6 credits of
courses that are offered during the summer term (inclusive of SG/CW credits). Out of these
6 credits, for students who have completed the 2nd year of their B.Tech. program, may be
allowed to take up to 4 credits for IP/IS/UR/BTP. An exception may be made for the
students of the graduating batch, who may be allowed to take up to 8 credits. The
registration shall be done just before the start of the term. There will not be any late
registration in the summer term and a student shall not be allowed to add a course after
registration.
5.8 Academic Load
In general, students will take courses as per the program. Normal load for the first and
second year students is 16-20 credits and for the third and fourth year students is 16-22
credits.
When a student registers for more credits than the stipulated normal load, it is called the
overload. First year students cannot take any overload. Second year students having a
CGPA of more than 8.0 can take an overload of up to 2 additional credits over 20 credits.
Third and fourth year students having a CGPA of more than 8.0 can take an overload of up
to 2 additional credits over 22 credits.
When the student registers for less than 16 credits in a semester, it is called the underload.
A student may be allowed, with permission of the DOAA an underload of a maximum of 4
credits below 16 credits.
Students under academic warning may not be permitted any overload. Such students may
be advised by DOAA to take an underload.
Students can avail underload below 12 credits (as low as 4 credits) only in one semester
during their entire B.Tech. program. For this, prior permission is required to be taken
8
before the last date of add/drop of that particular semester. Students wanting to avail
internship (industrial, academic, research, etc.) without taking semester leave can do so
with prior approval of the DOAA in only one semester of their degree program. Such
request needs to be placed at least two days before the last date of add/drop. Students
approved for such internship are required to register for 4 credits of only
IP/IS/UR/BTP/OC courses in this semester. Students will not be allowed to do any in-class
course during the internship period. Further, the underload of as low as 4 credits can be
availed by ECE, CSAM and CSSS students in any semester of the 3rd and 4th year, while
CSE, CSD and CSB students can do so only in the 8th Semester.
6
Teaching and Evaluation
6.1 Teaching
Each course is conducted by the Instructor-in-charge with the assistance of tutors and/or
teaching assistants. The Instructor-in-charge is responsible for conducting the lectures,
tutorials, and labs, holding the tests and examinations, evaluating the performance of the
students, awarding grades at the end of the semester/summer term, and transmitting the
grades to the DOAA's office within the prescribed time limit.
6.2 Continuous Evaluation System
(1) The Institute follows a system of continuous evaluation, in which, during a course,
various instruments like tests, exams, assignments, projects, etc., are given by the
instructor to assess the learning of students and assign grades. All evaluations are the
responsibility of the instructor in-charge of the course. The two main exams - the mid-
semester exam and the end-semester exam - shall normally be scheduled as per the
academic calendar while the schedule of the rest will be decided by the Instructor. For 1
or 2 credit courses, the Instructor will decide the evaluation criteria and the schedule of
tests and exams.
(2) Make-up Exam: If a student, for valid reasons such as illness, etc., fails to appear in the
end-semester examination in one or more course(s), he/she may make a request to the
instructor and the academic office for a make-up examination within two days of the date
of the scheduled examination. Such a request must, however, be supported by proper
documentary evidence for justifying the request. For medical reasons, only two medical
applications including mid-semester and end-semester would be accepted for make-up
examinations during the entire duration of the B.Tech. degree completion. Further, for the
grant of medical leave, students are required to upload the medical certificate within five
working days from the date of the missed examination. The Institute reserves the right to
get the medical certificate verified from the Institute Doctor. Finally, the request for
make-up examination will be approved by the DOAA.
9
6.3 Grading Scheme
(1) One of the letter grades given in the following table shall be awarded to a student
reflecting his/her overall performance in a course. Each letter grade carries certain points
as given in the table, and these points are used in the computation of the SGPA/CGPA as
explained later.
Letter Grade
Grade
Points
Remarks
A+ (Outstanding)
10
Letter grades A+ to F and I are given only in the
regular courses.
This grading scheme is effectively A to F. A+ grade
is only to recognize excellent performers in a
course, though it has the same grade points as an A
grade.
A (Very Good)
10
A(-)
9
B (Good)
8
B(-)
7
C (Satisfactory)
6
C(-)
5
D (Marginal)
4
F (Fail)
2
F Grade is not counted in the calculation of CGPA,
however, it is counted in the calculation of SGPA.
I (Incomplete)
Nil
Incomplete (I grade) must be converted to one of
the letter grades (A to F) as per the academic
calendar
W(Withdrawn)
Nil
"W" grade shall be printed in the transcript of the
students who do ‘Late Drop'
S (Satisfactory)
Nil
S and X are grades for only certain kinds of courses
like Audit course. They are not incorporated in
SGPA/CGPA calculation.
X (Unsatisfactory)
Nil
(2) In the academic courses, the final grades awarded are A to F (A+ is a grade with same
points as A, and is there to honor excellence).
(3) An I (Incomplete) grade may be awarded in cases when all the requirements for a course
are not met by the student at the time of submission of grades and it essentially reflects as
an "incomplete" status in the Evaluation Resource Planning (ERP) system. For all
courses including project-based courses, this grade must be converted to a regular grade
within one month of the end of the current term (i.e., the moderation date). For courses
other than project / independent study, incomplete grade "I" is meant primarily for
medical reasons. All unconverted "I" grades are automatically converted to F grade after
the grade conversion deadline, which is one month after the moderation date.
(4) In certain courses, such as Online Courses (OC, Self-Growth (SG and Community Work
(CW courses, only S or X grade is awarded.
(5) The F and X grades are "fail" grades and the student shall be required to repeat the
course. If the course is a compulsory course, the student shall repeat the same course in
10
another semester/summer when the course is offered. In the case of an elective/optional
course, the student can replace the course by another elective course.
(6) For at most one compulsory (core) course, after getting an F twice in the course, a student
may be allowed to replace it by an elective course of the respective discipline with the
prior approval from DOAA.
(7) An F and X grade obtained in any course shall be reflected in the grade sheet. However,
when the course is replaced or repeated, the new grade will be used for computation of
the CGPA. The pass grade for the respective course will count towards the SGPA of the
semester in which the course is passed and not in the semester where ‘F' grade was
awarded. ‘F' grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, although it is
counted in the calculation of SGPA.
6.4
Change of Grade Already Awarded
As mentioned in Ordinances, a letter grade, once awarded, shall not be changed unless
the request is made by the Instructor-in-Charge of the course and is approved by the
Chairman, Senate. Any such request for change of grade must, however, be made within
four weeks of the start of the next semester with all relevant records and justification.
6.5
(i) Grade Improvement
For some important core courses, refresher modules may be offered during vacations for
students' benefit. Students having Cor a lower grade earlier in the course, may be
allowed to enroll in these courses. Based on their performance in the refresher module,
their grade may be improved by at most one letter grade (i.e. improvement from F to D,
D to C, and Cto B-). Decision regarding whether these modules are to be offered during
vacation and whether they may be used for grade enhancement will be taken every year.
As with a grade change, this grade improvement will be approved and authorized by
Chairman, Senate.
(ii) UG students to repeat (Improvement) of a particular course
Repeat of a course completed with pass grade may be allowed, but only the best Grade
in that course will be counted for CGPA computation. Also, all attempts in that course
will be recorded in the respective semesters' transcripts and the repeat course will not be
permitted for late drop after mid-semester examination. For repeating a course, a student
has to simply register on ERP during the course registration period.
11
6.6 Performance Indicators
(1) The semester performance is indicated by a Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)
which is a weighted sum of all the points earned in the courses done in a semester. The
SGPA is given for each semester and is computed using the following formula.
SGPA = (u1.w1 + u2.w2 + … + un.wn) / (u1 + u2 + … + un)
where ui is the number of credits for the course i and wi is the points earned through the
letter grade in that course, and n is the number of courses taken in the semester. While
doing the computation of SGPA, the course/thesis credits with grades S and X are
ignored.
(2) The overall performance is indicated by a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)
which is computed in the same manner as the computation of SGPA but for all the
courses done in the program.
‘F' grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, however, it is counted in the
calculation of SGPA.
(3) The grades in courses will be announced over ERP at the end of every semester. A grade
report for the semester may be issued to a student after the semester upon request. The
grade report may be withheld if the student has not paid the fees or other dues, has a
disciplinary case pending against him/her, has not completed other formalities, or for any
other pertinent reason.
6.7 Transfer of Credits
Students may be permitted to do academic work and courses in places of repute outside
IIIT-Delhi and may be allowed to spend up to 2 semesters at another University. The
maximum credit transfer allowed is 40 credits over the entire B.Tech. program (with a
maximum of 20 credits in a semester). Based on their performance/quantum of work
done and the contents of the course/work, some credits may be transferred for similar
courses/projects. Institutions with which IIIT-Delhi has arrangements/MOU/student
exchange programs, transfer of credits may also be permitted. This transfer of credits will
be approved on a case-by-case basis by the DOAA and will be reported to the Senate.
6.8
B.Tech. students are allowed to do "extra credits" beyond 156 credits
 B.Tech. students are allowed to do "extra credits" beyond 156 credits required for
completion of B.Tech. requirement. For N extra credits done, the student will be
allowed worst grades in N credits, with a maximum limit of at most 8 credits, to
be not counted towards CGPA computation. The impact of this decision will be
reviewed after two batches have graduated with this option. Following method
will be used for calculating the CGPA:
Method: The below method will automatically decide which extra credits will not
be counted in CGPA:
12
 For CGPA computation at the end of 6th semester, baseline credits will be 116
(equal to 29 full courses including OC but excluding SG & CW). If a student has done
N credits more than 116, then for CGPA computation the following will be done:
- The worst grades in courses totaling M credits will be "removed", where M=
min{8, N}.
- CGPA will be computed based on the remaining credits. It is to be noted that since
OC's are with S/X Grades, although they will be included in baseline 116 credits, they
will not be counted in CGPA. For example, if a student has done 120 credits including
OC of 4 credits, CGPA will be computed from best grades corresponding to 112
credits.
 For CGPA computation at the end of 7th semester, baseline credits will be 136
(including OC but excluding SG & CW).
 CGPA computation for Honors students at the end of 8th semester will done
similar to a non-Honors student, i.e., he will be allowed to not-count worst grades
of courses up to 8 credits. For example, if a student has done 164 credits
(excluding SG/CW credits) including OC of 4 credits, CGPA will be computed
from best grades corresponding to 152 credits.
General Rules:
 SGPA computation will remain the same for each semester.
 CGPA computation will remain the same for first 5 semesters, even if a student
has done "extra credits."
6.9 B.Tech. student, who has already completed his/her graduation requirement (including
registration for a minimum of 8 semesters on campus), will be allowed to register for at
most two extra courses to improve his/her CGPA. Registration after completion of 156
credits, required for graduation, will be allowed in only one extra semester. Further,
registration of extra credits will be permitted provided he/she pays fees for that extra
semester. Moreover, such students will not be considered for any award/medal.
7
Continuing in the Program
For continuing in the undergraduate program, the student has to show satisfactory academic
performance as may be defined by the Senate from time to time. If the academic
performance falls short, a student may be asked to repeat the first year, placed under
warning, or his/her program may be terminated.
13
7.1 Rules for the first year (excluding the summer term scheduled after the first year)
(1) A student will be put on probation at the end of the first semester, if he/she passes 2
or less technical courses (courses other than Communication Skills) in the first
semester. For details about department wise technical and non-technical courses of
first year, refer program-wise regulations.
(2) If a student passes 3 or less technical courses in the entire first year provided he/she
did not take semester leave in any of the two semester, his/her program will be
terminated.
If a student passes 3 or less technical courses in the entire first year and was on leave
in either of the two semesters, he will have to repeat the first year, i.e., he/she has to
do first semester in the next academic year and will not be allowed to continue with
the third semester.
(3) If a student passes 4 or 5 technical courses in the entire first year, he/she will have to
repeat the year. Further, if a student passes 3 or less technical courses in the first
semester, he/she will be allowed to take semester leave in the Semester 2 or can
continue in Semester 2. However, in both the cases, he has to follow rule 2 mentioned
above.
(4) If a student repeating the first year fails in more than 1 technical courses in either
semester of the repeat year, his/her program will be terminated.
(5) A student repeating the first year may be allowed transfer of credits only for the non-
technical courses that he/she had passed in his/her previous attempt.
Regular rules for backlog will apply for any courses he/she may have failed.
7.2 Academic Warning/Probation
A student shall be placed under academic warning/probation on the grounds of
inadequate academic performance for one (subsequent) semester
(1) If he/she fails in any course in a semester
(2) If he/she gets an SGPA of 4.5 or less in a semester, or has a CGPA of 4.5 or less at
the end of the semester.
The following will apply to a student who is placed on a warning (academic as well as
warning due to disciplinary reasons):
14
(1) The student will not be allowed to hold any elected or nominated post for any
institute body including the hostel management, students' activities, and student
council.
(2) The student will not be allowed to participate in any event outside the Institute as

(3) No academic overload shall be permitted to such students.
(4) The students may be required by the DOAA to take an underload.
(5) The student will be required to sign an undertaking to agree and follow all stipulated
conditions of warning. All such undertakings shall be countersigned by the
parent/guardian of the student.
7.3 Attendance and Leave of Absence
(1) A student is expected to attend all classes. For any absence of more than two days, the
student should apply for and take a leave of absence. Penalty for students' whose
attendance falls below a threshold will be as decided by Senate from time to time, and
communicated to students.
(2) A student may be allowed to take semester leave, with permission before the last date of
add/drop, for any valid reason, as determined by UGC, including but not limited to ill
health, internships, entrepreneurship, family requirements, etc. No semester leave will be
granted after the last date of add/drop other than for the critical reasons such as ill health
(In such cases, no fee refund is admissible if the student has registered for the semester
which is converted to the semester leave later.) A student shall not be permitted more
than four semester leaves in the entire program. Any circumstance leading to more than
four semester leave/drop may result in the automatic termination of the program. This
implies that a student has to necessarily be registered and physically be present on
campus for 8 semesters during his/her degree program.
(3) If a student is absent from the Institute for more than 20 days in a semester due to
medical or any other reason, this may be converted to a semester leave for that semester
by DOAA. However, if a student represents IIIT-Delhi in some event, with prior
permission of Dean of Students Affairs, absence due to this participation will not be
counted.
7.4 Appeals
A student, whose program has been terminated, may appeal against the decision. All such
appeals shall be made to the Senate within two weeks, and the decision of the Academic
Senate shall be final. Other academics related appeals may be made to UGC.
15
7.5 Branch Transfer
Transfer of B.Tech. students from one program to the other is possible only after the
grades of the first semester are out. This is the only time branch change will occur. A
student must make an explicit request to be considered for program transfer within in a
week from the date of announcement of results of the first semester. In his/her request, the
student can mention more than one program in the order of preference. Rules for program
transfer are:

Only the students who satisfy eligibility for a particular branch at the time of admission
are eligible for transfer to that branch.
2.
Students admitted through AICTE need to produce NOC from AICTE if applying for
transfer to another program.
3.
Students must have passed all credits specified for the first semester of the B.Tech.
program.
4.
To be eligible for transfer to Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Computer Science
and Applied Mathematics (CSAM) or Computer Science and Design (CSD) program or

Students eligible for program transfer will be ordered in a priority list based on CGPA and
will be granted transfer in order as long as the strength of each program does not violate the
following limits.
6.
The base strength of a program for a batch will be the number of students who were
admitted and who are still enrolled in the program as on Dec 15 (after Sem 1) after
completion of one semester, not counting those who were repeating the first year. (E.g.
Suppose 110 students were admitted in a batch and there were 8 repeaters. If 6 of the
admitted students dropped out before Dec 15, then the base strength will be 110-6=104).
The final strength of any program shall not reduce by more than 10% of its base strength.
Also, the final strength of any program shall not increase by more than 10% of its base
strength.
 Repeaters who are repeating first year are also allowed branch transfer under the
above-mentioned rules.
 In case of a tie in CGPA of students, below tie breaking rules will be followed for
deciding transfer from one branch to another
16
Tie Breaking Rule I - For transfer to CSE, CSAM, CSD, CSSS and CSB branches, higher
grade in the order of Introduction to Programming, Maths-I, System Management, Digital
Circuits, Communication Skills
Tie Breaking Rule II -Higher JEE Rank

General
(1) This document gives the general regulations applicable to all BTech programs. Specific
requirements for a particular BTech program (e.g. BTech in Computer Science and
Engineering) are specified in regulations for that program.
(2) While the Senate is the main statutory body for all academic matters, the Undergraduate
Committee (UGC), a standing committee of Senate, shall oversee matters related to the
undergraduate program. This committee shall be appointed by the Senate and shall have a
term of two years. It will consist of Faculty members and members of the Senate. In
addition, there will be at least one student representative, who will be a full time UG student
of the Institute.
(3) Any condition arising in the BTech program and not covered in the regulations shall be
referred to the UG committee which may refer it to the Senate.
(4) Dean of Academic Affairs (DOAA) is the main functionary who ensures the smooth
functioning of the academic programs as approved by the academic Senate, executes the
policies and decisions of the Senate and UGC and PGC. DOAA's office receives, processes
and maintains all records relating to the undergraduate programs including curricula,
courses offered, academic calendar, registration, leave, examinations, grades and award of
degrees and prizes; disseminates information and issues orders pertaining to all academic
matters; processes requests from students regarding academic matters.

Admission
Number of Seats
The total number of seats will be as decided by the Board of Governors and will be
announced every year in the prospectus. No change in the total number of seats will be done
after the merit list for admission has been announced. The Board may also decide to have a
special supernumerary quota for foreign students.
Admission Criteria
Admission to the undergraduate program at IIIT-Delhi is based on criteria which use scores

admission for them is handled separately. The number of seats and the process for
application and admission are described in the prospectus every year.
Non-degree Students
A non-degree student is a student registered for a degree in a recognized university/ institute
in India or abroad and who is officially sponsored by that Institute/university to complete
part of the academic requirements at IIIT-Delhi. Such students may do courses or projects
in IIIT-D, and will be given transcripts for the academic work carried out at IIIT-Delhi.
During their stay at IIIT-D, such students will also be governed by all academic and
disciplinary rules of IIIT-Delhi. Credits earned by a non-degree student at IIIT-Delhi cannot
be applied towards any degree/diploma offered by IIIT-Delhi at any time. The admission to
non-degree status is decided on a case to case basis. The applications are received by the
Dean, Academic Affairs.
4
Courses and Credits
(1) Every semester the Institute offers some courses, taught by faculty appointed by it.
(2) A course may be of 4, 2, or 1 credit. A registered student who passes a course earns the credits
assigned for that course.
a) A 4-credit course. The course will have 3 hours of lectures per week, with a total of
about 39 hours of lectures (13 weeks). In addition, one hour of interaction per week
is expected, which may be in form of structured tutorials. There may also be labs in
the course.
5
b) A 2-credit course. The course will have 1.5 hrs lectures per week for the whole
semester, or 3 hrs. lectures per week for half the semester. The total lectures hours
will be about 20. Intensive short-term courses of 2 credits are also possible, though
it is expected that the duration of such a course will not be less than 3 weeks. A 2-
credit course may or may not have tutorials and labs.
c) A 1-credit course. The course is likely to be run as a short course on a very
specialized topic. Such courses may also be run during vacations. A 1-credit course
will have a total of about 10 hours of lecture over a period of, generally, not less than
2 weeks.
d) Certain courses such as self growth, community work, may be taken for variable
number of credits.
(3) While taking courses in the Institute is the primary means for a student to earn credits, there
may be other approved provisions for earning credit through projects, studying in other
Institutions and transferring credits, etc. Such provisions will be provided in these or other
regulations.
(4) Online Courses
IIIT-Delhi has evolved a system for allowing students to take online courses. Students can
take advantage of the increasing amount of such courses made available by reputed
universities across the world to complement the courses offered in the institute.
6
a) A B.Tech. student is allowed registration of online course (OC) as regular courses ( not in the
category of IP/IS/UR).
b) It is also clarified that the limit "one course in a semester" for OC means that "no more than 4
credits of OC can be taken in a semester".
5
Registration
1. At the beginning of each semester, a student shall register for the courses he/she wishes to
take in that semester. A student shall normally be allowed to register for a course only if
he/she has passed all the necessary pre-requisites for that course.
2. Registration is compulsory for all students who are not on leave of absence, and is the sole
responsibility of the student and must be completed before the last date of registration.
Failure to register may lead to termination of the program of the student for that semester.
5.1 Registration Procedure
(1)
Registration will generally be done just before the start of classes in a semester.
Pre-registration for a semester can be done toward the end of the previous semester.
Students will be informed about these dates and other details every semester.
(2)
Registration process has two parts: academic, and administrative and both must be
completed in order to complete the registration process. Academic registration includes
specifying the courses that the student wishes to do in the semester and getting the
necessary approvals. Students can seek advice from Advisors nominated for the purpose
by Dean of Academic Affairs. Administrative part includes paying all dues to the Institute.
5.2 Late Registration
Late registration is permitted as per academic calendar on the payment of late registration
fee. The late fee may be waived if the delay is due to an academic activity undertaken with
prior permission. The number of days missed due to late arrival shall be treated as leave of
absence. A fee for late academic registration may be imposed.
5.3 Pre-registration of Courses
Pre-registration is necessary part of the academic registration for non-first semester
students. In case a student fails to do pre-registration of courses, a penalty may be imposed
if the student does not register his/her preference within the stipulated period.
5.4 Adding or Dropping of Courses
A student can change the courses that he/she does in a semester by adding and dropping
courses till the last date for add/drop as specified in the academic calendar. In addition, a
student can withdraw from at most one elective course up to the last date specified in the
7
academic calendar, which will normally be after the mid-semester examination. During the
summer term, a student may be permitted to drop one course any time.
5.5 Registration of Students with Backlogs
A student has a backlog if he/she has not taken or has taken but failed in course(s) of
previous semester(s). The registration of such a student must be approved by the DOAA
who will advise the student. Generally, the student should register in a manner that he/she
can clear as many backlog courses as are available.
5.6 Cancellation of registration
A student is solely responsible to ensure that all conditions for proper registration are
satisfied, and there are no timetable clashes. The registration may be cancelled by DOAA
for a course if any irregularity is found at a later stage. A student's registration for the
semester may be cancelled as part of disciplinary action. Leave beyond permissible limits
may also result in cancellation of registration for a semester.
5.7 Summer term registration
Registering in the summer term is optional. A student may register for up to 8 credits of
courses that are offered during the summer term.Out of this 8 credits a student may be
allowed up to 4 credits for IP/IS/UR/BTP except that students of the graduating batch may
be allowed up to 8 credits for BTP. The registration shall be done just before the start of
the term. There will not be any late registration in the summer term and a student shall not
be allowed to add a course after registration.
5.8 Academic Load
Normally students will take courses as per the program. Normal load for a semester is 16
to 20 credits. An overload is defined as when a student takes more than 20 credits in a
semester. An underload is defined as when the student registers for less than 16 credits in
a semester. A student may be allowed, with permission of the Dean, Academic Affairs
(DOAA) an overload of up to 4 credits in a semester. Students in the Honors program are
allowed 4 credit overload in one semester during the last four semesters of their program,
without needing permission for the same. Students under warning or with weak academic
record may not be permitted any overload. Such students may be advised by DOAA to take
an under-load. Under-load for other students may be permitted by DOAA. A student can
also take an underload. For a load of 12 to 16 credits, no permission is necessary; a lesser
load may be allowed with permission.

Teaching and Evaluation
6.1 Teaching
Each course is conducted by the Instructor-in-charge with the assistance of tutors and/or
teaching assistants. The Instructor-in-charge is responsible for conducting the lectures,
tutorials, and labs, holding the tests and examinations, evaluating the performance of the
8
students, awarding grades at the end of the semester/summer term, and transmitting the
grades to the DOAA's office within the prescribed time limit.
6.2 Continuous Evaluation System
(1) The Institute follows a system of continuous evaluation, in which, during a course, various
instruments like tests, exams, assignments, projects etc. are given by the instructor to assess
the learning of students and assign grades. All evaluations are the responsibility of the
instructor in-charge of the course. The two main exams - the mid-sem exam and the end-
semester exam - shall normally be scheduled as per the academic calendar while the
schedule of the rest will be decided by the Instructor. For 1 or 2 credit courses, the
Instructor will decide the evaluation criteria and the schedule of tests and exams.
(2) Make-up Exam. If a student, for valid reasons such as illness, etc., fails to appear in the
end-semester examination in one or more course(s), he/she may make a request to the
instructor for a make-up examination within two days of the date of the scheduled
examination. Such a request must, however, be supported by proper documentary evidence
for justifying the request. For medical reasons, a doctor's certificate is needed, which must
be appropriately countersigned by a parent. Only one make-up examination, for the end-
semester examination, is allowed per course. For failures to appear in mid-semester
examinations, etc., it is entirely up to the Instructor to ascertain the proficiency of the
student by whatever means he/she considers appropriate if he/she is satisfied with the
reason(s) of absence given by the student.
6.3 Grading Scheme
(1) One of the letter grades given in the following table shall be awarded to a student reflecting
his/her overall performance in a course. Each letter grade carries certain points as given in
the table, and these points are used in the computation of the SGPA/CGPA as explained
later.
Letter Grade
Grade
Points
Remarks
A+ (Outstanding)
10
Letter grades A+ to F and I are given only in the
regular courses.
This grading scheme is effectively A to F; A+ is only
to recognize excellent performers in a course - it has
same points as A.
A (Very Good)
10
A(-)
9
B (Good)
8
B(-)
7
C (Satisfactory)
6
C(-)
5
D (Marginal)
4
F (Fail)
2
F Grade is not counted in the calculation of CGPA,
however, it is counted in the calculation of SGPA.
I (Incomplete)
Nil
Incomplete (I grade) must be converted to one of
the letter grades (A to F) as per the academic
calendar
9
W(Withdrawn)
Nil
"W" grade shall be printed in the transcript of the
students who do ‘Late Drop'
S (Satisfactory)
Nil
S and X are grades for only certain kinds of courses
like Audit course. They are not incorporated in
SGPA/CGPA calculation.
X (Unsatisfactory)
Nil
(2) In the academic courses, the final grades awarded are A to F (A+ is a grade with same
points as A, and is there to honor excellence).
(3) An I (Incomplete) grade may be awarded in cases when all the requirements for a course
are not met by the student at the time of submission of grades, and essentially reflects an
"incomplete" status in the course. This grade must be converted to a regular letter grade
(A+ to F) before the registration date of the next semester. For courses other than project /
independent study, I is meant primarily for medical reasons. All unconverted I grades get
automatically converted to F after the grade conversion deadline.
(4) In certain courses, such as self-growth and community service courses, only S or X grade
is awarded.
(5) The F and X grades are "fail" grades and the student shall be required to repeat the course.
If the course is a compulsory course, the same course shall be repeated in another
semester/summer when the course is offered. In the case of an elective/optional course, the
student can replace the course by another elective course.
(6) For at most one compulsory course, after getting an F twice in the course, a student may
be allowed to replace it by an elective course with the permission from DOAA.
(7) An F and X grade obtained in any course shall be reflected in the grade sheet. However
when the course is replaced or repeated, the new grade will be used for computation
of the CGPA. ‘F' grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, however, it is
counted in the calculation of SGPA.
6.4
Change of Grade Already Awarded
As mentioned in Ordinances, a letter grade once awarded shall not be changed unless the
request is made by the Instructor-in-Charge of the course and is approved by the Chairman,
Senate. Any such request for change of grade must, however, be made within four weeks
of the start of the next semester with all relevant records and justification.
6.5
(i) Grade Improvement
For some important core courses, refresher modules may be offered during vacations for
students' benefit. Students who got a low grade earlier in the course, may be allowed to
enroll in these and based on their performance in the refresher module, their grade may be
improved by at most one letter grade. Decision regarding whether these modules are to be
offered during vacation and whether they may be used for grade enhancement will be taken
10
every year. As with a grade change, this grade improvement will be approved and
authorized by Chairman, Senate.
(ii) UG students to repeat (Improvement) of a particular course
Repeat of a course completed with pass grade may be allowed, but only the best Grade in
that course be counted for CGPA computation. Also all attempts in that course will be
recorded in the respective semester transcripts. It is also made clear that a repeat course
will not be permitted to be dropped after mid-semester examination.
6.6 Performance Indicators
(1) The semester performance is indicated by a Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) which
is a weighted sum of all the points earned in the courses done in a semester. The SGPA is
given for each semester and is computed using the following formula.
SGPA = (u1.w1 + u2.w2 + … + un.wn) / (u1 + u2 + … + un)
where ui is the number of credits for the course i and wi is the points earned through the
letter grade in that course, and n is the number of courses taken in the semester. While
doing the computation of SGPA, the course/thesis credits with grades S and X are ignored.
(2) The overall performance is indicated by a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) which
is computed in the same manner as the computation of SGPA but for all the courses done
in the program.
‘F' grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, however, it is counted in the
calculation of SGPA.
(3) A grade report for the semester is issued to each student after the semester. The grade report
may be withheld if the student has not paid the fees or other dues, has a disciplinary case
pending against him/her, has not completed other formalities, or for any other pertinent
reason.
6.7 Waiver and Transfer of Credits
Students may be permitted to do academic work and courses in places of repute outside
IIIT-Delhi. Based on their performance/quantum of work done and the contents of the
course/work, some credit requirements may be waived for similar courses/projects.
Institutions with which IIIT-D has arrangements/MOU/student exchange programs,
11
transfer of credits may also be permitted. This transfer/waiver of credits will be done on a
case-by-case basis by the DOAA, and will be reported to the Senate.
6.8
BTech students allowed to do "extra credits" beyond 152 credits
BTech students are allowed to do "extra credits" beyond 152 credits required for completion
of B.Tech. requirement, and for N extra credits done, allow worst grades in N credits, with a
maximum limit of 8 credits, to be not counted towards CGPA computation. The impact of this
decision will be reviewed after two batches have graduated with this option Following method
to be usedfor calculating the CGPA:
Method: (Automatically decide which extra credits to be not counted in CGPA)
For CGPA computation at the end of 6th semester, baseline credits will be 116
(equal to 29 full courses including OC). If a student has done N credits more than 116,
then for CGPA computation the following will be done:
- The worst grades in courses totaling M credits will be "removed", where M=
min{8, N}.
- CGPA will be computed based on the remaining credits. It is to be noted that since OC's
are with S/X Grades, although they will be included in baseline 116 credits, they will
not be counted in CGPA. e.g. If a student has done 120 credits including OC of 4 credits,
CGPA will be computed from best grades corresponding to 112 credits.
For CGPA computation at the end of 7th semester, baseline credits will be 136.
General Rules:
SGPA computation will remain the same for each semester.
CGPA computation will remain the same for first 5 semesters, even if a student
has done "extra credits."
7
Continuing in the Program
For continuing in the undergraduate program the student has to show satisfactory academic
performance as may be defined by the Senate from time to time. If the academic
performance falls short, a student may be asked to repeat the first year, placed under
warning, or his/her program may be terminated.
12
7.1 Rules for the first year
(1) A student will be put on probation at the end of the 1st semester, if he/she passes 2 or
less CSE/Maths/ECE courses in the first semester.
(2) If a student passes 3 or less CSE/Math/ECE courses in the entire first year provided
he/she did not take semester leave in either of the two semester , his/her program will
be terminated.
If a student passes 3 or less CSE/Math/ECE courses in the entire first year and was on
leave in either of the two semesters, he will have to repeat the first year i.e. he has to
do first semester in the next academic year and will not be allowed to continue with the
3rdsemester
(3) If a student passes 4 or 5 CSE/Math/ECE courses only in the entire first year, he/she
will have to repeat the year.

more than four semester leaves in the entire program. Any circumstances leading to more
than four semester leave/drop may result in automatic termination of the program. This
implies that a student has to necessarily be registered and physically be present on campus
for 8 semesters during his degree program.
(3) If a student is absent from the Institute for more than 20 days in a semester due to medical
or any other reason, this may be converted to a semester leave for that semester by DOAA.

admitted and who are still enrolled in the program as on July 1st after completion of two
semesters, not counting those who were repeating the first year. (E.g. Suppose 110
students were admitted in a batch, and there were 8 repeaters. If 6 of the admitted
students and 3 of the repeaters dropped out before July 1, then the base strength will be
110-6=104) The final strength of any program shall not reduce by more than 10% of its

6. Change from one Program to another
(1) A student can change his/her registration from one program to another. All such requests
shall be made by the student along with the supporting documents. After evaluation of
9
the requests, the AAC may approve the change. The credits for the courses and thesis
shall be transferred to the new program. The change shall not be permitted if the
academic performance in the old program is not good enough for continuation in the new
program. After the changes, the rules for the new program shall be applicable.
(2) A Ph.D. student can change his/her program to M.Tech.. If this change is done by a
student, he/she will be treated as being in the M.Tech. program from the start of his/her
program, and will have to refund the difference in fees and stipend between the Ph.D. and
M.Tech. programs, if any.
(3) If a Ph.D. student fails two reviews, then the AAC may propose either that he or she
leaves the institute; or enroll in the M.Tech. program. If the latter, then usually full
M.Tech. fees would be payable by the student, along with any differences in stipends. In
some cases, the stipend difference may be reduced, waived or deferred on case-by-case
basis.
A warning letter will be issued by the Academic Section to students when they fail the
first review which should also explain the above.
(4) In special cases when a Ph.D. thesis is not found suitable for Ph.D., the candidate can
convert to M.Tech. and resubmit the thesis with suitable enhancements for M.Tech. (and
ensure that other requirements are met). In such a case, repaying of difference in stipends
and fees may be waived. Students enrolled in all those disciplines in which the institute
does not currently offers Masters program, if a student fails his or her comprehensive
exam or the Ph.D. thesis is not found suitable, migration to a different program is not
possible.
(5) An M.Tech. student can change his/her program, if permitted, to Ph.D. and continue to do
the course/research work to enable him/her to meet the requirements of the Ph.D. degree.
Only students with CGPA >8.00 and who have completed minimum of 2 semesters and
20 credits in M.Tech. program will be eligible to apply for the change to Ph.D. program.
The student will be eligible for Ph.D. stipend only from the time he/she is approved for
enrollment as the Ph.D. student. Such a student, for Ph.D. credit requirement, may be
treated as if he/she had joined the Ph.D. program from the start of the PG (here, M.Tech)
program. The student may be granted an M.Tech. degree also, provided he/she fulfils all
the academic requirements for the same. Such a student may also be refunded his/her
M.Tech. tuition fee, if he/she successfully completes the Ph.D. program.
10
7. Ph.D. Student getting an M.Tech.
A student admitted in the Ph.D. program after a B.Tech. can obtain an M.Tech. degree "on
the way" provided he/she completes the academic requirements for the same. For this:
Courses done for Ph.D. can count towards the M.Tech. degree.
Work done in the Scholarly Paper or M.Tech. thesis cannot be included in the Ph.D.
thesis.
A Ph.D. student can apply for an M.Tech. degree only after completing the
Comprehensive examination and after spending at least five semesters in the Institute.
If a Ph.D. student who obtains an M.Tech. degree and leaves the Institute without
completing his/her Ph.D., he/she will be considered as having changed his program
from Ph.D. to M.Tech. (and will have to refund the difference between stipend and
fees as per rules.)
Courses such as Summer Refresher Courses will be waived off for such students.
If
OOPD/AP
and
RM
are
taken
by
the
student
either
during
the
B.Tech./M.Tech./Ph.D. in IIITD, they are not required to complete these courses
again.
8. Registration
(1) General
a. All Postgraduate students, full time as well as part time, are required to register each
regular semester, unless they are on approved leave of absence. If a student is
working outside the Institute (e.g. working with an external co-supervisor) must
register through electronic means.
i. If a PhD student does not register on ERP, (s)he will be marked "Absent Without
Leave", and his/her fellowship and other facilities will be stopped immediately.
If an M.Tech. student does not register on ERP, (s)he will be marked "Absent
Without Leave". If a candidate remains "Absent Without Leave" for two
semesters, his/her registration shall be terminated and a termination letter will be
issued to the student with a copy to the Head of the Department (and to the
Advisor(s) in case of Ph.D. students). Regular reminders (minimum once a
month, so about 4-5 in a semester) will be sent to such students before issuing the
termination letter.
ii. The Annual Review shall be made mandatory for all Ph.D. students, even after
5th year of Ph.D. and no exceptions will be granted for annual reviews and as
long as any PhD student remains registered in the Ph.D. program, they will have
to appear and clear the annual reviews regularly.
iii. After the 5th year of Ph.D., the default fee waiver will be stopped. The student
must pay a fee equivalent to the fee applicable to sponsored students, failing
which his registration shall stand terminated. The Advisor(s) may request for a
waiver of fee in genuine cases.
11
iv. After completing 7 years in the Ph.D. program, all Ph.D. students will be
required to pay a fee equivalent to the fee applicable to sponsored students
mandatorily. The fee waiver request will not be accepted in any case.
v. Ph.D. students can be allowed to register courses and complete the program
within a maximum of 10 years.
vi. The maximum duration of the Ph.D. program will be 10 years from the date of
joining. If a Ph.D. student does not submit his/her thesis within 10 years from the
date of joining, his/her registration will be terminated and a termination letter
will be issued to the student with a copy to the Head of the Department and to the
Advisor(s).
Note: The above rules will be applicable from the Academic year 2023-24 and the
October 13, 2023 (60th Senate Date) will be considered as Day zero for all students.
b. Registration process has two parts: Academic, and administrative and both must
be completed in order to complete the registration process. Academic registration
includes filling the registration form and specifying the courses that the student
plans to do in the semester and getting it approved. Administrative part includes
paying all dues to the Institute. A student who is working outside the Institute
may get this completed through a friend/advisor/admin, etc.
c. A student shall normally register for courses if their course requirement
conditions are not fulfilled. A student may register for the courses and thesis
simultaneously in a semester. Thesis/Scholarly Paper registration will be in
multiple "courses" of 4 credits each (i.e. for 8 credits, a student will have to
register for two thesis courses, each of 4 credits).
d. Online Courses: IIIT-Delhi has evolved a system for allowing students to take online
courses. Students can take advantage of the increasing amount of such courses made
available by reputed universities across the world to complement the courses offered in
the institute.
PG students can do Online Courses under approved IP/IS credits of their specific
discipline/program and will be awarded regular grade (A to F) by the concerned
faculty supervisor.
(2) Pre-Registration of Courses
Pre-registration is necessary part of the academic registration for non-first semester
students. In case a student fails to do pre-registration of courses, a penalty may be
imposed if the student does not register his/her preference within the stipulated period.
12
(3) Late Registration
a. Late registration is permitted as per academic calendar on the payment of late
registration fee. The late fee may be waived if the delay is due to an academic activity
undertaken with prior permission. The number of days missed due to late arrival shall
be treated as leave of absence. A fee for late academic registration may be imposed.
(4) Adding or Dropping of Courses
a. A student can change the courses that he/she does in a semester by adding and
dropping courses till the last date for add/drop as specified in the academic calendar.
In addition, a student can drop, with permission from the Chair PG Affairs, some
courses even beyond the last date for add/drop, i.e. before the late drop date
mentioned in the academic calendar.
(5) Cancellation of registration
A student is solely responsible to ensure that all conditions for proper registration are
satisfied, and there are no timetable clashes. The registration may be cancelled by DOAA
for a course if any irregularity is found at a later stage. A student's registration for the
semester may be cancelled as part of disciplinary action. Leave beyond permissible limits
may also result in cancellation of registration for a semester.
(6) Summer term registration
Registration in the summer term is optional. But if a PG student is doing some academic
work, he/she is required to register. A PG student on financial plan of the Institute is
expected to remain in the Institute and work during the summer term even if he/she is not
registered, though he/she may take vacation as per rules. A student can register for up to
8 credits of which up to 4 credits can be for thesis work/IS.
(7) Registration of an Audit Course
A PG/Ph.D. student can be allowed to take a course as Audit on the condition that it will
count in the maximum course load for a semester but not in the calculation of CGPA.
Further, the faculty teaching the course will specify the requirements including attendance
and a minimum passing grade right in the beginning. The final grade for Audit course will,
however, be ‘S" or ‘X'. A student having "X" grade in a audit course can do the course
again as audit or credit. However, a student having "S" grade in an audit course, cannot do
the same course again.
9. Leave Rules
The students may be granted leave of absence on application to the AAC. The following
leaves are applicable:
13
(1) Vacation and casual leave
a. A post graduate student on financial assistance plan from the Institute may be allowed
vacation leave during any period of Institute's vacation or during the mid-semester
recess up to a maximum of 15 days per semester (six months), subject to a maximum
of 30 days at a time. Leave not availed in one semester may be carried over to the

leave if it views that granting of the leave can hinder the completion of the PG
program of the student. All students taking such leave, must report for registration the
next semester, even if they do not have any course requirement next semester. Any
relaxation of this guideline will be decided by the AAC, and will be granted only on
academic grounds (e.g. a student is attending a conference).
(4) Semester leave
a. Semester leave may be granted to students by the AAC upon recommendations of the
supervisor on various accounts, including medical, for up to a maximum of two
semesters in the program. In the case of semester leave, the academic registration of

(2) Continuous evaluation
a. As specified in the Regulations for B.Tech. Program
(3) Grading scheme
a. One of the letter grades given in the following table shall be awarded to a student
reflecting his/her overall performance in a course. Each letter grade carries certain
points as given in the table, and these points are used in the computation of the
SGPA/CGPA as explained later.
b. In the academic courses, the final grades awarded are A to F (A+ is a grade with same
points as A, and is there to honor excellence).
c. An I (Incomplete) grade may be awarded in cases when all the requirements for a
course are not met by the student at the time of submission of grades, and it
essentially reflects an "incomplete" status in the ERP. For all courses including
project based courses this grade must be converted to a regular letter grade (A to F, S
or X) within six weeks after the moderation date. For courses other than project /
independent study, incomplete grade "I" is meant primarily for medical reasons. All
Letter Grade

unconverted "I" grades are automatically converted to F grade after the grade
conversion deadline, which is within six weeks after the moderation date.
d. All courses in which a student obtains an F grade must be repeated or replaced by
another equivalent course.
e. Thesis/Scholarly Paper registration will be in multiple "courses" of 4 credits each (i.e.
for 8 credits, a student will have to register for two thesis courses with the name
M.Tech. Thesis progress, M.Tech. Scholarly Paper progress, M.Tech Capstone
Project progress each of 4 credits) and S/X grades will be assigned to each of these.
At the end of the last semester, the student will register for 16 credits of M.Tech.
Thesis and final letter grade will be awarded at the end of Thesis defense for full 16
credits which will be counted towards SGPA and CGPA. Similarly, for scholarly
paper, student will be register for 4/8 credits of M.Tech. Scholarly Paper in the last
semester and the final letter grade will be awarded after the submission of SP report
to the advisor. Further, student's advisor(s) also has(have) to submit a report for
student's progress to AAC.
(4) Performance Indicators - SGPA and CGPA
a. The semester performance is indicated by a Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)
which is a weighted sum of all the points earned in the courses done in a semester.
The SGPA is given for each semester and is computed using the following formula.
SGPA = (u1.w1 + u2.w2 + … + un.wn) / (u1 + u2 + … + un),
Where ui is the number of credits for the course i and wi is the points earned through
the letter grade in that course.
b. While doing the computation of SGPA, the course/thesis credits with grades S and X
are ignored.
c. The overall performance is indicated by a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)
which is computed in the same manner as the computation of SGPA but for all the
courses done in the program. While the F and X grades shall show on the grade sheet,
the original grade of a course repeated/replaced is ignored in the computation of
CGPA.
d. ‘F' grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, however, it is counted in
the calculation of SGPA.
18
13. Minimum Academic Performance Requirements
(1) M.Tech. program
a. The minimum graduating CGPA is 6.5.
b. The minimum SGPA/CGPA for continuing in the program is 6.0. If the SGPA/CGPA
falls below this, the student may be placed under warning first, and if the performance
does not improve, may be asked to leave the program.
(2) Ph.D. program
a. The minimum graduating CGPA is 7.5.
b. The minimum continuing CGPA is 7.0. If the CGPA falls below this, he/she may be
asked to shift to M.Tech. program or leave.
c. If the SGPA in the first semester falls below 7, the student concerned will be issued a
warning by Academic Section.
14. Students under Warning
(1) For a student who is under academic warning there will not be any financial penalty
because of academic warnings in the case of Ph.D. students. Similarly, such students can
also be assigned TAships. However, the student will not be allowed to be on any
elected/nominated committee representing students of the Institute, and if s/he is on any
committee he/she shall resign.
15. Requirements for the M.Tech. Degree
(1) Per Semester Load Requirements
A normal full time load is 12 credits to 20 credits including the credits of OOPD, RM and
TAship. For the students doing TA duty, it will count as 4 credit load. A student may be
permitted an overload of at most 4 credits in a semester in 2rd and subsequent semesters if
he/she has CGPA>8.00. Students who have completed the stipulated course requirements
shall register for thesis or scholarly paper in multiple "courses" of 4 credits each (i.e. for
8 credits, a student will have to register for two thesis courses, each of 4 credits) and S/X
grades will be assigned to each of these. No overload shall be permitted in the thesis unit
registration. Part time students may register for any number of credits lesser than the
normal full-time load.
19
(2) Course Work Requirements
a. A student may do an M.Tech. with thesis or with scholarly paper or without ‘thesis

complete 48 credits of course work. The supervisor or the AAC may advise the
students with insufficient background to do additional course credits. In addition,
students are required to do some "refresher" modules for strengthening their
background. These modules will be reflected in the transcript.
For the students admitted in academic year 2018-19 onwards, the grades earned in the
`Summer refresher' courses will not be counted towards CGPA calculation and in 48
credits of degree requirements. However, summer refresher grades will reflect in the
transcript. The grades for `Object Oriented Programming' and `Research Methods'
will count towards CGPA and the credits for these courses will be over and above 48
credits degree requirement.
b. An M.Tech. student must complete the core/bucket requirements for completion of
degree. He/she can replace upto two courses falling under the category of elective by
another elective and IS/IP by another IS/IP. Further, a core course grade can only be
replaced by a core course.
c. M.Tech. students can also repeat a course which they have already done for grade
improvement, in such cases best of the 2 grades will count towards the CGPA. An
M.Tech. student may also be allowed to do extra courses. All such permissions shall
be granted by the AAC upon requests from the students
(3) Thesis/Scholarly Paper credit and Total Credit requirements
a. For M.Tech. with-thesis, a student has to complete a minimum of 16 credits of thesis.
For M.Tech. with scholarly paper, he/she has to complete 4 or 8 credits of scholarly
paper. The total minimum credit requirements for an M.Tech. degree is 48 credits
(32+16 for M.Tech. with thesis, and 40+8 or 44+4 for M.Tech. with scholarly paper).
A M.Tech. student can also do M.Tech. without ‘Thesis and Scholarly Paper', i.e
with 48 credits of course work. However, for some programs Thesis is a mandatory
requirement for which students are required to refer program specific requirements.
20
b. For the purpose of grading in the thesis/scholarly paper credits registered, the
progress in the thesis/scholarly paper work shall be assessed by the thesis
supervisor(s). For each semester, one S (if the performance is satisfactory) or one X
(if the performance is not satisfactory) grade shall be awarded by the thesis
supervisor(s) to each of the registered thesis/scholarly paper courses of 4 credit each.
In the last semester a letter grade shall be awarded for the complete 16 credits of
Thesis/4 or 8 credits of Scholarly Paper.
(4) Thesis Option: Supervisor, Evaluation, and Defense
a. The M.Tech. thesis shall be done under the guidance of thesis supervisor(s), who
shall be regular faculty member(s) of the Institute or a Visiting Faculty (with a Ph.D
degree). A thesis may also have co-supervisors, who may be Adjunct Faculty of the
Institute, or external co-supervisors approved by the AAC.
b. An M.Tech. thesis shall be evaluated by an evaluation committee which shall consist
of the supervisor(s), including co-supervisors, and two other non-supervisor
examiners. For a thesis, it is desirable to have one of the examiners from outside the
Institute. The committee must be approved by the AAC.
c. The M.Tech. thesis must be defended by the student in front of the thesis evaluation
committee. The defense should be held no earlier than one-week after the thesis has
been submitted (exceptions may be granted by Chair PG Affairs). The thesis
evaluation committee shall make its recommendation to the AAC.
d. For Scholarly paper the evaluation committee consists of only the Supervisor (s).
e. For Capstone project the evaluation committee consists of Supervisors which include
supervisor from industry/research lab. The grades for members in a team will be
decided by the supervisors of the project, based on their assessment of the work done
by the members, and the extent to which they have been able to meet the deliverables
(5) Scholarly Paper Option: Supervisor and Evaluation
a. A student doing M.Tech. with Scholarly Paper has multiple options for completing
the scholarly paper requirement: a Regular Scholarly Paper and a Capstone Project.
b. Regular Scholarly Paper: The regular scholarly paper shall be done under the
guidance of a supervisor, who shall be a faculty member of the Institute. A scholarly
paper may also have co-supervisors, who may be Adjunct Faculty of the Institute, or
external co-supervisors approved by the AAC. For this scholarly paper, no defense is
required. It will be evaluated and signed by the supervisor(s) and the result along
with copy of Scholarly paper communicated to the Academic Administration.
21
c. Capstone Project: Scholarly paper can also be done through a capstone project. The
projects are usually defined by one or more faculty members who will act as
supervisors, but can include supervisors from industry or other academic institutions.
Students can undertake to do a project singly or in a team. The deliverables of the
project will be clearly specified by the supervisors, as will the grading scheme to be
adopted in meeting these deliverables. The grades for the students in the team will be
decided by the supervisors of the project, based on their assessment of the work
done/deliverables, and the project report. The grades along with a copy of project
report will be communicated to the Academic Administration.
(6) Award of degree
Upon a satisfactory report from the Dean, Academic Affairs, the Academic Senate may
recommend the award of the M.Tech. degree to the student. The default graduation date
for a M.Tech. student will be after completion of 2 years of the M.Tech. program. In case
a student completes his graduation requirements in 3 semesters and want to graduate with
an early date, he can request for the same. While pending the actual award of the degree
in a regular convocation of the Institute, the Dean of Academic Affairs may authorize the
Registrar to issue a provisional certificate to a student who completes the requirements
for graduation.
16. Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree
(1) General
A student shall be considered for the award of Ph.D. degree by the academic Senate only
upon the completion of the requirements mentioned here. Per semester load requirements
of Ph.D. students is same as for M.Tech. students. However, Ph.D. students who are on
assistantship may be given a relaxation of up to 8 credits in the normal full time load.
(2) Course Work Requirement
a. The requirement of the course work for a Ph.D. student is aimed at providing the
basic academic preparation to carry out the research, and have sufficient breadth in
the area. The minimum course requirement for a Ph.D. student is normally 32 credits
for students whose highest degree is a B.Tech. (or equivalent), and 16 for those who
have an M.Tech. (or equivalent). A Ph.D. student need to complete this requirement
only by doing courses of 500 level or above. However, a Ph.D. student can take any
300 level course for learning purpose. For a Ph.D. student taking on the way M.Tech.
300 level course will count towards M.Tech. as per the clause mentioned in M.Tech.
regulations. After the course work, the student is expected to have sufficient breadth
in at least three of the main sub-areas of Computer Science. The AAC may ask the
students with insufficient background to do additional courses (in addition to 32/16
credits).

23
Note: M.Tech. (including dual-degree M.Tech. students) and B.Tech. students joining Ph.D. program within two years of completing
their B.Tech./ M.Tech. degree from IIITD (irrespective of when they join) may be allowed by AAC to do one additional IS with
strong recommendation of Advisor(s).
b. In special cases, for students with advance standing by virtue of their academic
preparedness and/or by virtue of their professional work experience, some of the
course requirements may be waived. All such waivers shall be decided upon by the
AAC and reported to the Senate.
c. A Ph.D. student may be permitted to replace up to two courses done by him/her and
in which he/she has obtained passing, but not good, grade. The replacement will be
permitted as and when the request is made by the concerned student after publication
of result provided it does not result in underload. In this case, the earlier course will
be listed in the transcript as having been taken on "Audit". He/She may also be
permitted to do extra courses to improve the CGPA. All such permissions shall be
granted by the AAC upon requests from the students.
(3) Transfer of Credits and Grades for Courses done Outside
a. Students may be permitted to do academic work and courses in places of repute
outside IIIT-Delhi. Based on their performance/quantum of work done and the
content of the course, the AAC may consider them equivalent to some course credits,
and waive credit requirements for similar courses/projects within IIIT-Delhi.
b. Credits: Institutions with which IIIT-Delhi has arrangements/MOU/student exchange
programs, transfer of credits may also be permitted. Any such waivers/transfer is
permitted only if the courses being considered have not been counted for any other
degree/diploma requirement.
c. Grades: It is clarified that the CGPA of the course taken at other universities with whom we
have no MoU will not contribute towards the CGPA at IIITD. For the exchange program, we
will refer to the MoU to know if the grades should be counted in CGPA or not. If any student
does any course at some other University where there is no MoU, then by default, the grades
will not be counted towards the CGPA. These will only contribute to the total credits for
graduation at IIITD. It is also made clear that the counting of credits or CGPA will be dealt
with in accordance with the clarification given above.
(4) Thesis credit requirements
a. All Ph.D. students irrespective of their entry category are expected to successfully
complete a minimum of 56 credits by thesis. In truly exceptional cases where the
Ph.D. candidate is ready with a thesis before he/she has accumulated these credits, the
24
AAC can consider waiving off some of these credits. For the purpose of grading in
the thesis credits registered, the progress in the thesis work shall be assessed by the
thesis advisor(s). For each semester, one S (if the performance is satisfactory) or one
X (if the performance is not satisfactory) grade shall be awarded by the thesis
advisor(s). The thesis grades shall be submitted by the thesis advisor(s) at the end of
the semester.
Ph.D. students on completion of 5 years of registration will continue to do online
registration in the ERP and will present their progress of research work before the
monitoring committee till they submit the final thesis for evaluation.
(5) Thesis Advisor and External joint advisor
a. The thesis work shall be done under the guidance of the Ph.D. advisor, who shall be a
faculty member of the Institute. An adjunct faculty can also be an advisor, with
permission of the AAC. There may be multiple advisors. A student can change the
advisor later - for this a formal request will have to be submitted to AAC and has to
be signed by the old as well as the new advisors.
b. Assignment of Advisor(s) will be done as under:
1. For a student who is selected on project funding or Institute funding - the offer of
admission to be issued to the student will state that the student has to choose from one of the
following two options:
i. To be on specific project funding under X faculty. In this case, X faculty will
be the student advisor from Day 1 of his/ her Ph.D.
ii. To be on Institute funding, for which there may be more than one interested
faculty members (names will be disclosed in the admission offer letter) and
in this case, a student will have to finalize the advisor within a month of his/
her joining.
2. For a student who is selected on project funding - the offer of admission will state that
the student has been selected under X faculty member against Y project position. If he/ she is
keen to accept the offer, then he/ she may do so. In this case, X faculty will be the student
advisor from Day 1 of his/ her Ph.D.
3. For a student who is selected on Institute funding - the offer will state that the student
has been selected under Institute funding. In this case, names of all the interested faculty
members will be disclosed in the admission offer letter and the student will have to finalize
the advisor within a month of his/ her joining.
25
Ph.D. students coming through regular admissions will be required to join the Institute
at least a month before the add/ drop week. This practice may be started from the next
admission cycle.
A Ph.D. student selected through regular admissions will be on Institute fellowship for
the first month of his/ her Ph.D.
A Ph.D. student will be required to finalize the name of the Ph.D. advisor within a
month of his/ her joining the Ph.D. program and as early as possible. From the day of
assignment of Ph.D. advisor, the fellowship source of the student will count against
his/ her advisor.
c. A student may also have external joint advisor for the thesis. Such external joint
advisor shall be approved by the AAC upon a request by the student, duly approved
and forwarded by the advisor(s). The request must be accompanied by the CV/Bio or
sufficient information about the proposed external joint adviser which will allow the
AAC to evaluate the suitability. Normally, the external joint advisor should be
finalized before the comprehensive and the AAC should be informed by the adviser
and the student about the same.
d. Change/ Status of Advisor of a Ph.D. student when (i) Advisor (Regular faculty)
leaves IIITD and becomes adjunct faculty (ii) when the Advisor leaves the
Institute or when the student wants to change the Advisor and (iii) when the
Advisor (Regular faculty) goes on long leave.
The request should be considered as per guidelines available at Annexure.
(6) Monitoring Committee and Yearly Review / Yearly Seminar
a. The AAC shall form a monitoring committee for each candidate, whose task will be
to independently monitor and report on the progress of the candidate. The committee
should generally be formed before the end of the candidate's second semester in the
program and should consist of at least three faculty members/experts.
b. The monitoring committee shall submit its evaluation about the progress of the candidate,
at least once a year. If the monitoring committee feels that the candidate is not making
sufficient progress, it may recommend suitable actions to be taken, including
recommending that the student leave the Ph.D. program or migrate to M.Tech., as given
in 6(3). This review may be done by requiring the Ph.D. students to make presentations
about their progress, or through some other method.
(7) Comprehensive
The aim of the comprehensive examination is to check the understanding of the Ph.D.
student about his/her area of research. (Though a comprehensive traditionally was meant
26
to check that the student has sufficient breadth, the Institute feels that this type of breadth
requirement should be fulfilled through courses, and the comprehensive should be used to
test the "comprehension" of the candidate about his/her main area of research.) For the
comprehensive, the student shall present a complete literature survey (much on the lines
of papers in ACM Surveys), research proposal and research plan on his/her area of work.
The survey report will be submitted to the committee formed for the comprehensive
exam by the AAC. The student will present a seminar on the above. The seminar should
be open for all to attend. After the seminar, the committee may examine the student
further and will submit its report regarding the outcome of the comprehensive to the
AAC. If the student fails the examination, he/she is allowed an additional half a semester
( i.e. 3 months) to retry.
A. Eligibility criteria to take the comprehensive exam

available on the academic resources page.
(8) Regular Seminars / Yearly Review
This requirement for regular seminar or a yearly review is moved to item (6).
(9) Teaching Requirements
a. One of the potential career options for the research students is academics. The Ph.D.
program at IIIT-Delhi aims to develop suitable teaching skills among the research
students through teaching requirements. Towards this, it requires all students on
financial assistantship plan of the Institute are required to take part in the teaching
activities.
b. All Ph.D. students must be TA for at least two semesters to satisfy the teaching
requirements for a Ph.D. degree. Students on research assistantship will also be
required to complete this requirement, though they may be assigned lighter load each
semester. The feedback received from the course students on the TA work will be
part of the Ph.D. student record, and will be an input in evaluation.
c. Below are the TA rules
1) A Ph.D. student getting institute fellowship for full duration of Ph.D. is required to
do TA duty for 8 semesters
2) A Ph.D. student who is RA (throughout) is required to do TA duty for a minimum
of two semesters
Institute support for 1st year followed by Project support
for the remaining duration - 2 TA duty must
Institute support for 1stand 2ndyear followed by Project
28
Support for the remaining duration - 4 TA duty must
Institute support for 1st, 2ndand 3rdyear followed by Project
Support for the remaining duration - 6 TA duty must
Institute support for 1st, 2nd, 3rdand 4th year followed by
Project Support for the remaining duration - 6 TA duty must
Institute support till 9th Semester followed by Project
Support for the remaining duration - 7 TA duty must
TA duty to be done in the first 4 years.
If a student has not done the required TA duty, TA portion of the stipend shall be
deducted.
d. Students will be assigned their TA duties towards the end of a regular semester for
courses in the next semester. During the break, they should prepare themselves for the
course, and with help from the instructor, design the assignments, develop the
solutions and grading of the assignments. They will also be involved in the grading of
the exam papers and developing the solutions to the exam papers. Senior students are
also encouraged to be a tutor as well as take part in the class room teaching, along
with the corresponding instructors. Such arrangements are to be worked out between
the instructor in-charge of the course and the student. It is expected that the load of
TA work in a semester will be similar to that of a course, that is, approximately 10
hours per week.
e. The teaching requirement may be waived for part-time and/or sponsored candidates
(as their professional goals are likely to be already defined.)
f. Issue of academic warning and termination of registration of Ph.D. students who are
not performing their TAship duties sincerely
Academic Section will take feedback about such TAs from faculty members on a monthly
basis. This will help in sensitizing the students who are not performing their TA duties. If a
Ph.D. student gets an "X" grade in TAship in one semester, then (s)he will be issued an
"Academic Warning". Further, if any Ph.D. student receives 2 such "Academic Warnings",
then his/her registration from the Ph.D. program will be terminated. Any academic warning /
termination letter issued to the Ph.D. student should also be shared with his/her PhD
advisor(s), so that Ph.D. advisor(s) can sensitize the student about the roles and
responsibilities of a TA.
29
(10) Thesis submission, Evaluation and Defense
Each Ph.D. student is expected to write a thesis report on the Ph.D. work. The thesis
has to be submitted by the student for evaluation. Guidelines for Ph.D. thesis
evaluation are given separately.
(11) Award of degree
a. Upon acceptance of the revised thesis by the AAC, the Chairman, Senate may
recommend the award of the Ph.D. degree to the student. While pending the actual
award of the degree in a regular convocation of the Institute, the Chairman, Senate may
also authorize the Registrar to notify the result and issue a provisional certificate to a
student who completes the requirements for graduation.
The date on the degree shall be as follows:
June 21 for the students who finish their requirements during the winter semester
(e.g. 4th semester of M.Tech.)
Sep 21 for those who finish the requirements during summer term.
Jan 21 for those who finish the requirement during the Monsoon semester
17. Prizes and Medals/Awards at Graduation
a. The academic Senate of the institute can set up awards, prizes, medals etc. to be given to
deserving students at graduation time.
b. Under exceptional circumstances, where gross violation of the conditions of the
awards/recognition or academic misconduct is detected at a later stage, the Senate may
recommend to the Board of Governors to withdraw the award and recognition
18. Disciplinary Action Framework
IIIT-Delhi maintains global academic standards in its own education system. Therefore, it
does not tolerate any form of indiscipline/ academic dishonesty. Action will be taken
against students found engaging in acts of indiscipline/ academic dishonesty by
Disciplinary Action Committee (DAC) constituted by the Director. The disciplinary
action may result in semester/year/two year drop or even expulsion from the Institute.
Separate rules and regulations have been formulated to handle the cases of violations.
19. Migration from B.Tech. to Dual Degree Program
30
A B.Tech. student can opt to migrate to dual degree program of the institute anytime
before the last date of Add/Drop of his/her 7th semester of the B.Tech. program.
Eligibility criteria for this and regulations for the dual degree program are given
separately.
20. Power to Modify
Notwithstanding all that has been stated above, the Senate has the right to modify any of
the above regulations from time to time.

Annexure
Status of Advisor (Primary/Co-advisor) of a Ph.D. student when Advisor (Regular faculty)
leaves IIITD and becomes adjunct faculty before and after the comprehensive examination
The Senate at its 55th meeting held on 27.7.2022 approved the following recommendation of the
Academic Affairs Committee (AAC) made in its 19th meeting held on July 13, 2022:
i. IITD does not use the terminology of primary advisor and co-advisor and instead calls
them joint advisors. The same should be used throughout.
ii. For students who have already completed their comprehensive:
a. The faculty member may continue as the sole Ph.D. advisor. In such cases, a
caretaker advisor will be appointed for administrative matters only. The
caretaker advisor will not be mentioned as an advisor in the thesis.
b. If there happens to be a case of major revision in the thesis, the advisor will be
asked to help the student in carrying out the major revision. If s/he is unable to
provide help for some reason, the caretaker advisor appointed in this case will
be requested to provide the help for carrying out the revision.
c. If the caretaker advisor provides substantial help in carrying out the major
revision, s/he can be appointed as a joint-advisor
d. Further, during the annual review, the monitoring committee will judge the
progress of the student and if it is deemed insufficient then the monitoring
committee may recommend having a joint-advisor from IIITD. The decision
of the joint-advisor will solely be of the student and existing advisor
. iii. For students who have not completed their comprehensive:
a. A joint-advisor from IIIT-Delhi will have to be appointed and the Ph.D.
student will be asked to find one and inform the Academic Section at the
earliest. The student will be treated as not having an advisor and same rules
will apply, i.e., in case the student does not find an advisor from the Institute in
6 months, s/he may be asked to leave the Ph.D. program.
Change of Advisor when (i) the Advisor leaves the Institute or (ii) when the student wants
to change the Advisor
Further to above the Senate also approved the following recommendation of the AAC made in its
20th meeting held on July 25, 2022:
Change of the Advisor when (i) the Advisor leaves the Institute or (ii) when the
student wants to change the Advisor:
35
Request for change of the Advisor may be considered as per the existing rules. If there is
any dispute between the student and the Advisor, the efforts should be made to settle the
matter amicably. However, if the matter can not be resolved amicably and the student
gives in writing that he/she will not include any part of the research work carried out
with his/her existing Ph.D. Advisor in his/her Ph.D. thesis, then the student may be
allowed to change the Advisor. The new advisor will have to ensure that no past work is
used."
.
These guidelines now supersede the previous guidelines related to change of Advisor, approved
in 32nd meeting of the Senate (Item 32.19).
Status of the Advisor when the Advisor (Regular faculty) goes on long leave.
The Senate also agreed to the recommendation/suggestions of the AAC made in its 19th meeting
held on July 13, 2022 and approved as under:
It is clarified that when the Advisor (Regular faculty) goes on long leave a Caretaker
Advisor will be appointed during the long leave on the recommendation of the existing
Advisor(s) / DOAA. It is also suggested that in the form for long leave the word ‘Co
advisor' should be changed to ‘Caretaker Advisor".

6. Change from one Program to another
(1) A student can change his/her registration from one program to another. All such requests
shall be made by the student along with the supporting documents. After evaluation of
9
the requests, the AAC may approve the change. The credits for the courses and thesis
shall be transferred to the new program. The change shall not be permitted if the
academic performance in the old program is not good enough for continuation in the new
program. After the changes, the rules for the new program shall be applicable.
(2) A Ph.D. student can change his/her program to M.Tech.. If this change is done by a
student, he/she will be treated as being in the M.Tech. program from the start of his/her
program, and will have to refund the difference in fees and stipend between the Ph.D. and
M.Tech. programs, if any.
(3) If a Ph.D. student fails two reviews, then the AAC may propose either that he or she
leaves the institute; or enroll in the M.Tech. program. If the latter, then usually full
M.Tech. fees would be payable by the student, along with any differences in stipends. In
some cases, the stipend difference may be reduced, waived or deferred on case-by-case
basis.
A warning letter will be issued by the Academic Section to students when they fail the
first review which should also explain the above.
(4) In special cases when a Ph.D. thesis is not found suitable for Ph.D., the candidate can
convert to M.Tech. and resubmit the thesis with suitable enhancements for M.Tech. (and
ensure that other requirements are met). In such a case, repaying of difference in stipends
and fees may be waived. Students enrolled in all those disciplines in which the institute
does not currently offers Masters program, if a student fails his or her comprehensive
exam or the Ph.D. thesis is not found suitable, migration to a different program is not
possible.
(5) An M.Tech. student can change his/her program, if permitted, to Ph.D. and continue to do
the course/research work to enable him/her to meet the requirements of the Ph.D. degree.
Only students with CGPA >8.00 and who have completed minimum of 2 semesters and
20 credits in M.Tech. program will be eligible to apply for the change to Ph.D. program.
The student will be eligible for Ph.D. stipend only from the time he/she is approved for
enrollment as the Ph.D. student. Such a student, for Ph.D. credit requirement, may be
treated as if he/she had joined the Ph.D. program from the start of the PG (here, M.Tech)
program. The student may be granted an M.Tech. degree also, provided he/she fulfils all
the academic requirements for the same. Such a student may also be refunded his/her
M.Tech. tuition fee, if he/she successfully completes the Ph.D. program.
10
7. Ph.D. Student getting an M.Tech.
A student admitted in the Ph.D. program after a B.Tech. can obtain an M.Tech. degree "on
the way" provided he/she completes the academic requirements for the same. For this:
Courses done for Ph.D. can count towards the M.Tech. degree.
Work done in the Scholarly Paper or M.Tech. thesis cannot be included in the Ph.D.
thesis.
A Ph.D. student can apply for an M.Tech. degree only after completing the
Comprehensive examination and after spending at least five semesters in the Institute.
If a Ph.D. student who obtains an M.Tech. degree and leaves the Institute without
completing his/her Ph.D., he/she will be considered as having changed his program
from Ph.D. to M.Tech. (and will have to refund the difference between stipend and
fees as per rules.)
Courses such as Summer Refresher Courses will be waived off for such students.
If
OOPD/AP
and
RM
are
taken
by
the
student
either
during
the
B.Tech./M.Tech./Ph.D. in IIITD, they are not required to complete these courses
again.
8. Registration
(1) General
a. All Postgraduate students, full time as well as part time, are required to register each
regular semester, unless they are on approved leave of absence. If a student is
working outside the Institute (e.g. working with an external co-supervisor) must
register through electronic means.
i. If a PhD student does not register on ERP, (s)he will be marked "Absent Without
Leave", and his/her fellowship and other facilities will be stopped immediately.
If an M.Tech. student does not register on ERP, (s)he will be marked "Absent
Without Leave". If a candidate remains "Absent Without Leave" for two
semesters, his/her registration shall be terminated and a termination letter will be
issued to the student with a copy to the Head of the Department (and to the
Advisor(s) in case of Ph.D. students). Regular reminders (minimum once a
month, so about 4-5 in a semester) will be sent to such students before issuing the
termination letter.
ii. The Annual Review shall be made mandatory for all Ph.D. students, even after
5th year of Ph.D. and no exceptions will be granted for annual reviews and as
long as any PhD student remains registered in the Ph.D. program, they will have
to appear and clear the annual reviews regularly.
iii. After the 5th year of Ph.D., the default fee waiver will be stopped. The student
must pay a fee equivalent to the fee applicable to sponsored students, failing
which his registration shall stand terminated. The Advisor(s) may request for a
waiver of fee in genuine cases.
11
iv. After completing 7 years in the Ph.D. program, all Ph.D. students will be
required to pay a fee equivalent to the fee applicable to sponsored students
mandatorily. The fee waiver request will not be accepted in any case.
v. Ph.D. students can be allowed to register courses and complete the program
within a maximum of 10 years.
vi. The maximum duration of the Ph.D. program will be 10 years from the date of
joining. If a Ph.D. student does not submit his/her thesis within 10 years from the
date of joining, his/her registration will be terminated and a termination letter
will be issued to the student with a copy to the Head of the Department and to the
Advisor(s).
b. Registration process has two parts: Academic, and administrative and both must
be completed in order to complete the registration process. Academic registration
includes filling the registration form and specifying the courses that the student
plans to do in the semester and getting it approved. Administrative part includes
paying all dues to the Institute. A student who is working outside the Institute
may get this completed through a friend/advisor/admin, etc.
c. A student shall normally register for courses if their course requirement
conditions are not fulfilled. A student may register for the courses and thesis
simultaneously in a semester. Thesis/Scholarly Paper registration will be in
multiple "courses" of 4 credits each (i.e. for 8 credits, a student will have to
register for two thesis courses, each of 4 credits).
d. Online Courses: IIIT-Delhi has evolved a system for allowing students to take online
courses. Students can take advantage of the increasing amount of such courses made
available by reputed universities across the world to complement the courses offered in
the institute.
PG students can do Online Courses under approved IP/IS credits of their specific
discipline/program and will be awarded regular grade (A to F) by the concerned
faculty supervisor.
(2) Pre-Registration of Courses
Pre-registration is necessary part of the academic registration for non-first semester
students. In case a student fails to do pre-registration of courses, a penalty may be
imposed if the student does not register his/her preference within the stipulated period.
(3) Late Registration
a. Late registration is permitted as per academic calendar on the payment of late
registration fee. The late fee may be waived if the delay is due to an academic activity
12
undertaken with prior permission. The number of days missed due to late arrival shall
be treated as leave of absence. A fee for late academic registration may be imposed.
(4) Adding or Dropping of Courses
a. A student can change the courses that he/she does in a semester by adding and
dropping courses till the last date for add/drop as specified in the academic calendar.
In addition, a student can drop, with permission from the Chair PG Affairs, some
courses even beyond the last date for add/drop, i.e. before the late drop date
mentioned in the academic calendar.
(5) Cancellation of registration
A student is solely responsible to ensure that all conditions for proper registration are
satisfied, and there are no timetable clashes. The registration may be cancelled by DOAA
for a course if any irregularity is found at a later stage. A student's registration for the
semester may be cancelled as part of disciplinary action. Leave beyond permissible limits
may also result in cancellation of registration for a semester.
(6) Summer term registration
Registration in the summer term is optional. But if a PG student is doing some academic
work, he/she is required to register. A PG student on financial plan of the Institute is
expected to remain in the Institute and work during the summer term even if he/she is not
registered, though he/she may take vacation as per rules. A student can register for up to
8 credits of which up to 4 credits can be for thesis work/IS.
(7) Registration of an Audit Course
A PG/Ph.D. student can be allowed to take a course as Audit on the condition that it will
count in the maximum course load for a semester but not in the calculation of CGPA.
Further, the faculty teaching the course will specify the requirements including attendance
and a minimum passing grade right in the beginning. The final grade for Audit course will,
however, be ‘S" or ‘X'. A student having "X" grade in a audit course can do the course
again as audit or credit. However, a student having "S" grade in an audit course, cannot do
the same course again.
9. Leave Rules
The students may be granted leave of absence on application to the AAC. The following
leaves are applicable:
13
(1) Vacation and casual leave
a. A post graduate student on financial assistance plan from the Institute may be allowed
vacation leave during any period of Institute's vacation or during the mid-semester
recess up to a maximum of 15 days per semester (six months), subject to a maximum
of 30 days at a time. Leave not availed in one semester may be carried over to the
next semester.
b. In addition, a student irrespective of the financial assistance may be allowed to go on casual
leave for up to 8 working days in a calendar year, with permission.
(2) On-Duty leave
a. A Ph.D. student may be granted on-duty leave for attending seminars, conferences,

his/her advisor as well as the AAC.
(3) Summer leave
a. A PG student who is on financial assistance may be granted leave during the summer
vacation period for undertaking internships, projects etc. This will be "leave without
pay" and during this period, the student will not get the assistantship/scholarship.
Decision on such leave requests will be made by the AAC, which may not grant this
leave if it views that granting of the leave can hinder the completion of the PG
program of the student. All students taking such leave, must report for registration the
next semester, even if they do not have any course requirement next semester. Any
relaxation of this guideline will be decided by the AAC, and will be granted only on
academic grounds (e.g. a student is attending a conference).
(4) Semester leave
a. Semester leave may be granted to students by the AAC upon recommendations of the
supervisor on various accounts, including medical, for up to a maximum of two
semesters in the program. In the case of semester leave, the academic registration of
the student shall be cancelled for that semester. The financial assistance to students
shall also be not available during the period of semester leave. An M.Tech. student
cannot avail semester leave for Internship during the first three regular semesters
(Monsoon and Winter) of the degree program. However, he/she may plan to graduate
by the end of the 3rd Semester for pursuing Internship in the 4th semester, after having
completed all the graduation requirements by the end of the 3rd semester.
b. When the total days of absence is more than 20 days in a semester, the student may be
required to take a semester leave.
(5) Medical leave

of the ongoing semester. The student has to inform the AAC and advisors in advance
(at least one month), complete the teaching duties, if any, return all the equipment's
and data, and get signatures on the no-dues form
10. Working with Collaborators outside IIIT-Delhi
(1) A PG student may interact and work with an approved external co-supervisor in a
collaborating organization. Students shall require permission from the AAC to proceed to
work with the external co-supervisor. All students working with the external co-
supervisor shall be governed by the following guidelines during the period of absence
from IIIT-Delhi.
a. Such students shall be required to register each semester as per the registration
procedure of IIIT-Delhi
b. The students are expected to follow the rules of the collaborating institute but shall
continue be governed by the rules and regulations of the IIIT-Delhi.
c. They shall be reporting to the external supervisor(s) for their research work on their
thesis and shall be in constant touch with the supervisor(s) at IIIT-Delhi. This may be
through a regular video/audio conferencing or through regular reporting.
d. Such students are permitted to register as a non-degree/visiting student in an institute
other than IIIT-Delhi and may transfer the credit. Transfer of credits will be decided
on a case-by-case basis by the AAC. The students can also take course on audit and
submit the performance records for the consideration of waiver of course
requirements if desired.
15
e. They shall not be provided any financial assistance from the Institute during the
period they are with the external co-supervisor. Financial assistance during these
periods shall be provided by the collaborating institute as per their norms, or some
other sources like scholarships from agencies, etc.
(2) When working with collaborators outside the Institute, the IP rights will be as decided
between the supervisor(s), and the sponsoring agency, if any. Any such arrangement shall
be done with the concurrence of the AAC, and shall not interfere with the ability of the
student to write his/her thesis and publish results of the work.
11. Internship rules for M.Tech. students
An M.Tech. student may do a single 6-month internship during the course of their
program. The earliest that this internship can take place is during the 4thregular Semester
only. The internships for M.Tech. students will be allowed under the approved internship
rules available on IIITD website.
M.Tech. students may be allowed to submit and defend their thesis during the internship,
provided the student has completed the thesis work and only thesis writing and defense is
pending. If a student has completed the thesis, then the advisor(s) may allow a student to go for
internship, and the student can defend the thesis while being on internship. Based on the
supervisor's recommendation, the Academic section will issue an NOC to students undertaking a
thesis and taking 16 credits for the thesis. The NOC will specifically mention that the thesis
defense is pending for the student. The graduation date will be decided in accordance with the
date of the thesis defense and the date of submission of the final thesis. This will not be
applicable to students taking capstone projects. Other rules for issuing NOC will remain the same.
The supervisor will have to submit the grade along with the final thesis as per the timeline
mentioned below

12. Teaching and Evaluation
(1) Teaching
a. As specified in the Regulations for B.Tech. Program
(2) Continuous evaluation
a. As specified in the Regulations for B.Tech. Program
(3) Grading scheme
a. One of the letter grades given in the following table shall be awarded to a student
reflecting his/her overall performance in a course. Each letter grade carries certain
points as given in the table, and these points are used in the computation of the
SGPA/CGPA as explained later.
b. In the academic courses, the final grades awarded are A to F (A+ is a grade with same
points as A, and is there to honor excellence).
c. An I (Incomplete) grade may be awarded in cases when all the requirements for a
course are not met by the student at the time of submission of grades, and it
essentially reflects an "incomplete" status in the ERP. For all courses including
project based courses this grade must be converted to a regular letter grade (A to F, S

other than project / independent study, incomplete grade "I" is meant primarily for
medical reasons. All unconverted "I" grades are automatically converted to F grade
after the grade conversion deadline, which is one month after the moderation date
d. All courses in which a student obtains an F grade must be repeated or replaced by
another equivalent course.
e. Thesis/Scholarly Paper registration will be in multiple "courses" of 4 credits each (i.e.
for 8 credits, a student will have to register for two thesis courses with the name
M.Tech. Thesis progress, M.Tech. Scholarly Paper progress, M.Tech Capstone
Project progress each of 4 credits) and S/X grades will be assigned to each of these.
At the end of the last semester, the student will register for 16 credits of M.Tech.
Thesis and final letter grade will be awarded at the end of Thesis defense for full 16
credits which will be counted towards SGPA and CGPA. Similarly, for scholarly
paper, student will be register for 4/8 credits of M.Tech. Scholarly Paper in the last
semester and the final letter grade will be awarded after the submission of SP report
to the advisor. Further, student's advisor(s) also has(have) to submit a report for
student's progress to AAC.
(4) Performance Indicators - SGPA and CGPA
a. The semester performance is indicated by a Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)
which is a weighted sum of all the points earned in the courses done in a semester.
The SGPA is given for each semester and is computed using the following formula.
SGPA = (u1.w1 + u2.w2 + … + un.wn) / (u1 + u2 + … + un),
Where ui is the number of credits for the course i and wi is the points earned through
the letter grade in that course.
b. While doing the computation of SGPA, the course/thesis credits with grades S and X
are ignored.
c. The overall performance is indicated by a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)
which is computed in the same manner as the computation of SGPA but for all the
courses done in the program. While the F and X grades shall show on the grade sheet,
the original grade of a course repeated/replaced is ignored in the computation of
CGPA.
d. ‘F' grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, however, it is counted in
the calculation of SGPA.
18
13. Minimum Academic Performance Requirements
(1) M.Tech. program
a. The minimum graduating CGPA is 6.5.
b. The minimum SGPA/CGPA for continuing in the program is 6.0. If the SGPA/CGPA
falls below this, the student may be placed under warning first, and if the performance
does not improve, may be asked to leave the program.
(2) Ph.D. program
a. The minimum graduating CGPA is 7.5.
b. The minimum continuing CGPA is 7.0. If the CGPA falls below this, he/she may be
asked to shift to M.Tech. program or leave.
c. If the SGPA in the first semester falls below 7, the student concerned will be issued a
warning by Academic Section.
14. Students under Warning
(1) For a student who is under academic warning there will not be any financial penalty because
of academic warnings in the case of Ph.D. students. Similarly, such students can also be assigned
TAships. However, the student will not be allowed to be on any elected/nominated
committee representing students of the Institute, and if s/he is on any committee he/she
shall resign.
15. Requirements for the M.Tech. Degree
(1) Per Semester Load Requirements
A normal full time load is 12 credits to 20 credits including the credits of OOPD, RM and
TAship. For the students doing TA duty, it will count as 4 credit load. A student may be
permitted an overload of at most 4 credits in a semester in 2rd and subsequent semesters if
he/she has CGPA>8.00. Students who have completed the stipulated course requirements
shall register for thesis or scholarly paper in multiple "courses" of 4 credits each (i.e. for
8 credits, a student will have to register for two thesis courses, each of 4 credits) and S/X
grades will be assigned to each of these. No overload shall be permitted in the thesis unit
registration. Part time students may register for any number of credits lesser than the
normal full-time load.
19
(2) Course Work Requirements
a. A student may do an M.Tech. with thesis or with scholarly paper or without ‘thesis
and scholarly paper'. In some programs, Thesis is a mandatory requirement for which
program specific regulations need to be referred. In with-thesis option, an M.Tech.
student must complete a minimum of 32 credits of course work. In the Scholarly
Paper option, the student must complete 40 or 44 credits (depending on the credits of
the Scholarly Paper). In without ‘thesis and scholarly paper' option, the student must
complete 48 credits of course work. The supervisor or the AAC may advise the
students with insufficient background to do additional course credits. In addition,
students are required to do some "refresher" modules for strengthening their
background. These modules will be reflected in the transcript.
For the students admitted in academic year 2018-19 onwards, the grades earned in the
`Summer refresher' courses will not be counted towards CGPA calculation and in 48
credits of degree requirements. However, summer refresher grades will reflect in the
transcript. The grades for `Object Oriented Programming' and `Research Methods'
will count towards CGPA and the credits for these courses will be over and above 48
credits degree requirement.
b. An M.Tech. student must complete the core/bucket requirements for completion of
degree. He/she can replace upto two courses falling under the category of elective by
another elective and IS/IP by another IS/IP. Further, a core course grade can only be
replaced by a core course.
c. M.Tech. students can also repeat a course which they have already done for grade
improvement, in such cases best of the 2 grades will count towards the CGPA. An
M.Tech. student may also be allowed to do extra courses. All such permissions shall
be granted by the AAC upon requests from the students
(3) Thesis/Scholarly Paper credit and Total Credit requirements
a. For M.Tech. with-thesis, a student has to complete a minimum of 16 credits of thesis.
For M.Tech. with scholarly paper, he/she has to complete 4 or 8 credits of scholarly
paper. The total minimum credit requirements for an M.Tech. degree is 48 credits
(32+16 for M.Tech. with thesis, and 40+8 or 44+4 for M.Tech. with scholarly paper).
A M.Tech. student can also do M.Tech. without ‘Thesis and Scholarly Paper', i.e
with 48 credits of course work. However, for some programs Thesis is a mandatory
requirement for which students are required to refer program specific requirements.
20
b. For the purpose of grading in the thesis/scholarly paper credits registered, the
progress in the thesis/scholarly paper work shall be assessed by the thesis
supervisor(s). For each semester, one S (if the performance is satisfactory) or one X
(if the performance is not satisfactory) grade shall be awarded by the thesis
supervisor(s) to each of the registered thesis/scholarly paper courses of 4 credit each.
In the last semester a letter grade shall be awarded for the complete 16 credits of
Thesis/4 or 8 credits of Scholarly Paper.
(4) Thesis Option: Supervisor, Evaluation, and Defense
a. The M.Tech. thesis shall be done under the guidance of thesis supervisor(s), who
shall be regular faculty member(s) of the Institute or a Visiting Faculty (with a Ph.D
degree). A thesis may also have co-supervisors, who may be Adjunct Faculty of the
Institute, or external co-supervisors approved by the AAC.
b. An M.Tech. thesis shall be evaluated by an evaluation committee which shall consist
of the supervisor(s), including co-supervisors, and two other non-supervisor
examiners. For a thesis, it is desirable to have one of the examiners from outside the
Institute. The committee must be approved by the AAC.
c. The M.Tech. thesis must be defended by the student in front of the thesis evaluation
committee. The defense should be held no earlier than one-week after the thesis has
been submitted (exceptions may be granted by Chair PG Affairs). The thesis
evaluation committee shall make its recommendation to the AAC.
d. For Scholarly paper the evaluation committee consists of only the Supervisor (s).
e. For Capstone project the evaluation committee consists of Supervisors which include
supervisor from industry/research lab. The grades for members in a team will be
decided by the supervisors of the project, based on their assessment of the work done
by the members, and the extent to which they have been able to meet the deliverables
(5) Scholarly Paper Option: Supervisor and Evaluation
a. A student doing M.Tech. with Scholarly Paper has multiple options for completing
the scholarly paper requirement: a Regular Scholarly Paper and a Capstone Project.
b. Regular Scholarly Paper: The regular scholarly paper shall be done under the
guidance of a supervisor, who shall be a faculty member of the Institute. A scholarly
paper may also have co-supervisors, who may be Adjunct Faculty of the Institute, or
external co-supervisors approved by the AAC. For this scholarly paper, no defense is
required. It will be evaluated and signed by the supervisor(s) and the result along
with copy of Scholarly paper communicated to the Academic Administration.
21
c. Capstone Project: Scholarly paper can also be done through a capstone project. The
projects are usually defined by one or more faculty members who will act as
supervisors, but can include supervisors from industry or other academic institutions.
Students can undertake to do a project singly or in a team. The deliverables of the
project will be clearly specified by the supervisors, as will the grading scheme to be
adopted in meeting these deliverables. The grades for the students in the team will be
decided by the supervisors of the project, based on their assessment of the work
done/deliverables, and the project report. The grades along with a copy of project
report will be communicated to the Academic Administration.
(6) Award of degree
Upon a satisfactory report from the Dean, Academic Affairs, the Academic Senate may
recommend the award of the M.Tech. degree to the student. The default graduation date
for a M.Tech. student will be after completion of 2 years of the M.Tech. program. In case
a student completes his graduation requirements in 3 semesters and want to graduate with
an early date, he can request for the same. While pending the actual award of the degree
in a regular convocation of the Institute, the Dean of Academic Affairs may authorize the
Registrar to issue a provisional certificate to a student who completes the requirements
for graduation.
16. Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree
(1) General
A student shall be considered for the award of Ph.D. degree by the academic Senate only
upon the completion of the requirements mentioned here. Per semester load requirements
of Ph.D. students is same as for M.Tech. students. However, Ph.D. students who are on
assistantship may be given a relaxation of up to 8 credits in the normal full time load.
(2) Course Work Requirement
a. The requirement of the course work for a Ph.D. student is aimed at providing the
basic academic preparation to carry out the research, and have sufficient breadth in
the area. The minimum course requirement for a Ph.D. student is normally 32 credits
for students whose highest degree is a B.Tech. (or equivalent), and 16for those who
have an M.Tech. (or equivalent). A Ph.D. student need to complete this requirement
only by doing courses of 500 level or above. However, a Ph.D. student can take any
300 level course for learning purpose. For a Ph.D. student taking on the way M.Tech.
300 level course will count towards M.Tech. as per the clause mentioned in M.Tech.
regulations. After the course work, the student is expected to have sufficient breadth
in at least three of the main sub-areas of Computer Science. The AAC may ask the
22
students with insufficient background to do additional courses (in addition to 32/16
credits).

*This will not be counted to minimum credit requirement and may be waived for those who did a same course during their
B.Tech./M.Tech. program at IIITD
**This waiver in coursework may only be provided with the permission from the thesis advisor and the dissertation committee.
***500-level courses (or higher) will be considered towards the Ph.D. program. However, students may be allowed to take at most
two advanced undergraduate courses (300-level or higher) with the permission of the thesis advisor and AAC.
****The course work will include mandatory courses from Design and will be taken from a bucket defined by the DRC of the dept.
Note: M.Tech. (including dual-degree M.Tech. students) and B.Tech. students joining Ph.D.
program within two years of completing their B.Tech./ M.Tech. degree from IIITD (irrespective of
when they join) may be allowed by AAC to do one additional IS with strong recommendation of
Advisor(s).
b. In special cases, for students with advance standing by virtue of their academic
preparedness and/or by virtue of their professional work experience, some of the
course requirements may be waived. All such waivers shall be decided upon by the
AAC and reported to the Senate.
c. A Ph.D. student may be permitted to replace up to two courses done by him/her and
in which he/she has obtained passing, but not good, grade. The replacement will be
permitted as and when the request is made by the concerned student after publication
of result provided it does not result in underload. In this case, the earlier course will
be listed in the transcript as having been taken on "Audit". He/She may also be
permitted to do extra courses to improve the CGPA. All such permissions shall be
granted by the AAC upon requests from the students.
24
(3) Transfer of Credits for Courses done Outside
a. Students may be permitted to do academic work and courses in places of repute
outside IIIT-Delhi. Based on their performance/quantum of work done and the
content of the course, the AAC may consider them equivalent to some course credits,
and waive credit requirements for similar courses/projects within IIIT-Delhi.
Institutions with which IIIT-Delhi has arrangements/MOU/student exchange
programs, transfer of credits may also be permitted. Any such waivers/transfer is
permitted only if the courses being considered have not been counted for any other
degree/diploma requirement.
b. It is clarified that the CGPA of the course taken at other universities with whom we have no
MoU will not contribute towards the CGPA at IIITD. For the exchange program, we will
refer to the MoU to know if the grades should be counted in CGPA or not. If any student does
any course at some other University where there is no MoU, then by default, the grades will
not be counted towards the CGPA. These will only contribute to the total credits for
graduation at IIITD. It is also made clear that the counting of credits or CGPA will be dealt
with in accordance with the clarification given above.
(4) Thesis credit requirements
a. All Ph.D. students irrespective of their entry category are expected to successfully
complete a minimum of 56 credits by thesis. In truly exceptional cases where the
Ph.D. candidate is ready with a thesis before he/she has accumulated these credits, the
AAC can consider waiving off some of these credits. For the purpose of grading in
the thesis credits registered, the progress in the thesis work shall be assessed by the
thesis advisor(s). For each semester, one S (if the performance is satisfactory) or one
X (if the performance is not satisfactory) grade shall be awarded by the thesis
advisor(s). The thesis grades shall be submitted by the thesis advisor(s) at the end of
the semester.
Ph.D. students on completion of 5 years of registration will continue to do online
registration in the ERP and will present their progress of research work before the
monitoring committee till they submit the final thesis for evaluation.
(5) Thesis Advisor and External joint advisor-
a. The thesis work shall be done under the guidance of the Ph.D. advisor, who shall be a
faculty member of the Institute. An adjunct faculty can also be an advisor, with
permission of the AAC. There may be multiple advisors. A student can change the
25
advisor later - for this a formal request will have to be submitted to AAC and has to
be signed by the old as well as the new advisors.
b. Assignment of Advisor(s) will be done as under:
1. For a student who is selected on project funding or Institute funding - the offer of
admission to be issued to the student will state that the student has to choose from one of the
following two options:
i. To be on specific project funding under X faculty. In this case, X faculty will
be the student advisor from Day 1 of his/ her Ph.D.
ii. To be on Institute funding, for which there may be more than one interested
faculty members (names will be disclosed in the admission offer letter) and
in this case, a student will have to finalize the advisor within a month of his/
her joining.
2. For a student who is selected on project funding - the offer of admission will state that
the student has been selected under X faculty member against Y project position. If he/ she is
keen to accept the offer, then he/ she may do so. In this case, X faculty will be the student
advisor from Day 1 of his/ her Ph.D.
3. For a student who is selected on Institute funding - the offer will state that the student
has been selected under Institute funding. In this case, names of all the interested faculty
members will be disclosed in the admission offer letter and the student will have to finalize
the advisor within a month of his/ her joining.
Ph.D. students coming through regular admissions will be required to join the Institute
at least a month before the add/ drop week. This practice may be started from the next
admission cycle.
A Ph.D. student selected through regular admissions will be on Institute fellowship for
the first month of his/ her Ph.D.
A Ph.D. student will be required to finalize the name of the Ph.D. advisor within a
month of his/ her joining the Ph.D. program and as early as possible. From the day of
assignment of Ph.D. advisor, the fellowship source of the student will count against
his/ her advisor.
c. A student may also have external joint advisor for the thesis. Such external joint
advisor shall be approved by the AAC upon a request by the student, duly approved
and forwarded by the advisor(s). The request must be accompanied by the CV/Bio or
sufficient information about the proposed external joint adviser which will allow the
AAC to evaluate the suitability. Normally, the external joint advisor should be
26
finalized before the comprehensive and the AAC should be informed by the adviser
and the student about the same.
d. Change/ Status of Advisor of a Ph.D. student when (i) Advisor (Regular faculty)
leaves IIITD and becomes adjunct faculty (ii) when the Advisor leaves the
Institute or when the student wants to change the Advisor and (iii) when the
Advisor (Regular faculty) goes on long leave.
The request should be considered as per guidelines available at Annexure.
(6) Monitoring Committee and Yearly Review / Yearly Seminar
a. The AAC shall form a monitoring committee for each candidate, whose task will be
to independently monitor and report on the progress of the candidate. The committee
should generally be formed before the end of the candidate's second semester in the
program and should consist of at least three faculty members/experts.
b. The monitoring committee shall submit its evaluation about the progress of the candidate,
at least once a year. If the monitoring committee feels that the candidate is not making
sufficient progress, it may recommend suitable actions to be taken, including
recommending that the student leave the Ph.D. program or migrate to M.Tech., as given
in 6(3). This review may be done by requiring the Ph.D. students to make presentations
about their progress, or through some other method.
(7) Comprehensive
The aim of the comprehensive examination is to check the understanding of the Ph.D.
student about his/her area of research. (Though a comprehensive traditionally was meant
to check that the student has sufficient breadth, the Institute feels that this type of breadth
requirement should be fulfilled through courses, and the comprehensive should be used to
test the "comprehension" of the candidate about his/her main area of research.) For the
comprehensive, the student shall present a complete literature survey (much on the lines

(8) Regular Seminars / Yearly Review
This requirement for regular seminar or a yearly review is moved to item (6).
(9) Teaching Requirements
a. One of the potential career options for the research students is academics. The Ph.D.
program at IIIT-Delhi aims to develop suitable teaching skills among the research
students through teaching requirements. Towards this, it requires all students on
financial assistantship plan of the Institute are required to take part in the teaching
activities.
b. All Ph.D. students must be TA for at least two semesters to satisfy the teaching
requirements for a Ph.D. degree. Students on research assistantship will also be
required to complete this requirement, though they may be assigned lighter load each
28
semester. The feedback received from the course students on the TA work will be
part of the Ph.D. student record, and will be an input in evaluation.
c. Below are the TA rules
1) A Ph.D. student getting institute fellowship for full duration of Ph.D. is required to
do TA duty for 8 semesters
2) A Ph.D. student who is RA (throughout) is required to do TA duty for a minimum
of two semesters
Institute support for 1st year followed by Project support
for the remaining duration - 2 TA duty must
Institute support for 1stand 2ndyear followed by Project
Support for the remaining duration - 4 TA duty must
Institute support for 1st, 2ndand 3rdyear followed by Project
Support for the remaining duration - 6 TA duty must
Institute support for 1st, 2nd, 3rdand 4th year followed by
Project Support for the remaining duration - 6 TA duty must
Institute support till 9th Semester followed by Project
Support for the remaining duration - 7 TA duty must
TA duty to be done in the first 4 years.
If a student has not done the required TA duty, TA portion of the stipend shall be
deducted.
d. Students will be assigned their TA duties towards the end of a regular semester for
courses in the next semester. During the break, they should prepare themselves for the
course, and with help from the instructor, design the assignments, develop the
solutions and grading of the assignments. They will also be involved in the grading of
the exam papers and developing the solutions to the exam papers. Senior students are
also encouraged to be a tutor as well as take part in the class room teaching, along
with the corresponding instructors. Such arrangements are to be worked out between
the instructor in-charge of the course and the student. It is expected that the load of
TA work in a semester will be similar to that of a course, that is, approximately 10
hours per week.
29
e. The teaching requirement may be waived for part-time and/or sponsored candidates
(as their professional goals are likely to be already defined.)
f. Issue of academic warning and termination of registration of Ph.D. students who are
not performing their TAship duties sincerely
Academic Section will take feedback about such TAs from faculty members on a monthly
basis. This will help in sensitizing the students who are not performing their TA duties. If a
Ph.D. student gets an "X" grade in TAship in one semester, then (s)he will be issued an
"Academic Warning". Further, if any Ph.D. student receives 2 such "Academic Warnings",
then his/her registration from the Ph.D. program will be terminated. Any academic warning /
termination letter issued to the Ph.D. student should also be shared with his/her PhD
advisor(s), so that Ph.D. advisor(s) can sensitize the student about the roles and
responsibilities of a TA.
(10) Thesis submission, Evaluation and Defense
Each Ph.D. student is expected to write a thesis report on the Ph.D. work. The thesis
has to be submitted by the student for evaluation. Guidelines for Ph.D. thesis
evaluation are given separately.
(11) Award of degree
a. Upon acceptance of the revised thesis by the AAC, the Chairman, Senate may
recommend the award of the Ph.D. degree to the student. While pending the actual
award of the degree in a regular convocation of the Institute, the Chairman, Senate may
also authorize the Registrar to notify the result and issue a provisional certificate to a
student who completes the requirements for graduation.
The date on the degree shall be as follows:
June 21 for the students who finish their requirements during the winter semester
(e.g. 4th semester of M.Tech.)
Sep 21 for those who finish the requirements during summer term.
Jan 21 for those who finish the requirement during the Monsoon semester
17. Prizes and Medals/Awards at Graduation
a. The academic Senate of the institute can set up awards, prizes, medals etc. to be given to
deserving students at graduation time.
30
b. Under exceptional circumstances, where gross violation of the conditions of the
awards/recognition or academic misconduct is detected at a later stage, the Senate may
recommend to the Board of Governors to withdraw the award and recognition
18. Disciplinary Action Framework
IIIT-Delhi maintains global academic standards in its own education system. Therefore, it
does not tolerate any form of indiscipline/ academic dishonesty. Action will be taken
against students found engaging in acts of indiscipline/ academic dishonesty by
Disciplinary Action Committee (DAC) constituted by the Director. The disciplinary
action may result in semester/year/two year drop or even expulsion from the Institute.
Separate rules and regulations have been formulated to handle the cases of violations.
19. Migration from B.Tech. to Dual Degree Program

Annexure
Status of Advisor (Primary/Co-advisor) of a Ph.D. student when Advisor (Regular faculty)
leaves IIITD and becomes adjunct faculty before and after the comprehensive examination
The Senate at its 55th meeting held on 27.7.2022 approved the following recommendation of the
Academic Affairs Committee (AAC) made in its 19th meeting held on July 13, 2022:
i. IITD does not use the terminology of primary advisor and co-advisor and instead calls
them joint advisors. The same should be used throughout.
ii. For students who have already completed their comprehensive:
a. The faculty member may continue as the sole Ph.D. advisor. In such cases, a
caretaker advisor will be appointed for administrative matters only. The
caretaker advisor will not be mentioned as an advisor in the thesis.
b. If there happens to be a case of major revision in the thesis, the advisor will be
asked to help the student in carrying out the major revision. If s/he is unable to
provide help for some reason, the caretaker advisor appointed in this case will
be requested to provide the help for carrying out the revision.
c. If the caretaker advisor provides substantial help in carrying out the major
revision, s/he can be appointed as a joint-advisor
d. Further, during the annual review, the monitoring committee will judge the
progress of the student and if it is deemed insufficient then the monitoring
committee may recommend having a joint-advisor from IIITD. The decision
of the joint-advisor will solely be of the student and existing advisor
. iii. For students who have not completed their comprehensive:
a. A joint-advisor from IIIT-Delhi will have to be appointed and the Ph.D.
student will be asked to find one and inform the Academic Section at the
earliest. The student will be treated as not having an advisor and same rules
will apply, i.e., in case the student does not find an advisor from the Institute in
6 months, s/he may be asked to leave the Ph.D. program.
Change of Advisor when (i) the Advisor leaves the Institute or (ii) when the student wants
to change the Advisor
Further to above the Senate also approved the following recommendation of the AAC made in its
20th meeting held on July 25, 2022:
Change of the Advisor when (i) the Advisor leaves the Institute or (ii) when the
student wants to change the Advisor:
35
Request for change of the Advisor may be considered as per the existing rules. If there is
any dispute between the student and the Advisor, the efforts should be made to settle the
matter amicably. However, if the matter can not be resolved amicably and the student
gives in writing that he/she will not include any part of the research work carried out
with his/her existing Ph.D. Advisor in his/her Ph.D. thesis, then the student may be
allowed to change the Advisor. The new advisor will have to ensure that no past work is
used."
.
These guidelines now supersede the previous guidelines related to change of Advisor, approved
in 32nd meeting of the Senate (Item 32.19).
Status of the Advisor when the Advisor (Regular faculty) goes on long leave.
The Senate also agreed to the recommendation/suggestions of the AAC made in its 19th meeting
held on July 13, 2022 and approved as under:
It is clarified that when the Advisor (Regular faculty) goes on long leave a Caretaker
Advisor will be appointed during the long leave on the recommendation of the existing
Advisor(s) / DOAA. It is also suggested that in the form for long leave the word ‘Co
advisor' should be changed to ‘Caretaker Advisor".

c. Only full-time regular students are eligible for assistantships and scholarships. A Ph.D.
student is not eligible for teaching assistantship or scholarship after five years.
d. The teaching/research assistantship for Ph.D. students comprises sustenance stipend
(35% of total), scholarship (15%), and remuneration for academic work (50%).
e. Assistantship for M.Tech. students will be viewed as remuneration for the academic
work (teaching/research) being performed atthe institute.
f. Teaching Assistantship for M.Tech. and Ph.D. students will be a ‘0' credit course which
will show up in Transcript. S or X grade will be allotted for the TA work.
(2) Other Financial Assistance
a. Certain other kinds of financial assistantship such as scholarships or fellowships might
also be available from sources other than the Institute.
(3) Withdrawal and reduction of financial assistantship
a. For Ph.D. students, the financial support continuation shall be contingent upon the
performance in academics and the assigned academic/administrative duties and will be
reviewed every semester. The scholarship part of the assistantship may be terminated
if the student's academic performance is not as per standards (defined later). The
remuneration part may be terminated or reduced if the student's performance in his/her
assigned duties is not satisfactory. The sustenance part may not be terminated or
reduced as long as the student remains a full time student of the Institute. The
8
reduction/termination, if any, shall be decided by the AAC committee each year, based
on the performance of the student.
b. For M.Tech. students, the financial support continuation shall be based on the academic
performance and the performance in assigned duties (teaching/research).
Continuation/reduction/termination of financial support will be decided by the AAC
every semester.
6. Change from one Program to another
(1) A student can change his/her registration from one program to another. All such requests
shall be made by the student along with the supporting documents. After evaluation of the
requests, the AAC may approve the change. The credits for the courses and thesis shall be
transferred to the new program. The change shall not be permitted if the academic
performance in the old program is not good enough for continuation in the new program.
After the changes, the rules for the new program shall be applicable.
(2) A Ph.D. student can change his/her program to M.Tech.. If this change is done by a student,
he/she will be treated as being in the M.Tech. program from the start of his/her program,
and will have to refund the difference in fees and stipend between the Ph.D. and M.Tech.
programs, if any.
(3) If a Ph.D. student fails two reviews, then the AAC may propose either that he or she leaves
the institute; or enroll in the M.Tech. program. If the latter, then usually full M.Tech. fees
would be payable by the student, along with any differences in stipends. In some cases, the
stipend difference may be reduced, waived or deferred on case by case basis.
A warning letter will be issued by the Academic Section to students when they fail the first
review which should also explain the above.
(4) In special cases when a Ph.D. thesis is not found suitable for Ph.D., the candidate can
convert to M.Tech. and resubmit the thesis with suitable enhancements for M.Tech. (and
ensure that other requirements are met). In such a case, repaying of difference in stipends
and fees may be waived. Students enrolled in all those disciplines in which the institute
does not currently offers Masters program, if a student fails his or her comprehensive exam
or the Ph.D. thesis is not found suitable, migration to a different program is not possible.
(5) An M.Tech. student can change his/her program, if permitted, to Ph.D. and continue to do
the course/research work to enable him/her to meet the requirements of the Ph.D. degree.
Only students with CGPA >8.00 and who have completed minimum of 2 semesters and 20
credits in M.Tech. program will be eligible to apply for the change to Ph.D. program. The
9
student will be eligible for Ph.D. stipend only from the time he/she is approved for
enrollment as the Ph.D. student. Such a student, for Ph.D. credit requirement, may be
treated as if he/she had joined the Ph.D. program from the start of the PG (here, M.Tech)
program. The student may be granted an M.Tech. degree also, provided he/she fulfils all
the academic requirements for the same. Such a student may also be refunded his/her
M.Tech. tuition fee, if he/she successfully completes the Ph.D. program.
7. Ph.D. Student getting an M.Tech.
A student admitted in the Ph.D. program after a B.Tech. can obtain an M.Tech. degree "on the
way" provided he/she completes the academic requirements for the same. For this:
 Courses done for Ph.D. can count towards the M.Tech. degree.
 Work done in the Scholarly Paper or M.Tech. thesis cannot be included in the Ph.D.
thesis.
 A Ph.D. student can apply for an M.Tech. degree only after completing the
Comprehensive examination and after spending at least five semesters in the Institute.
 If a Ph.D. student who obtains an M.Tech. degree and leaves the Institute without
completing his/her Ph.D., he/she will be considered as having changed his program from
Ph.D. to M.Tech. (and will have to refund the difference between stipend and fees as
per rules.)
 Courses such as Summer Refresher Courses will be waived off for such students.
 If OOPD/AP and RM are taken by the student either during the B.Tech./M.Tech./Ph.D.
in IIITD, they are not required to complete these courses again.
8. Registration
(1) General
a. All Postgraduate students, full time as well as part time, are required to register each
regular semester, unless they are on approved leave of absence. If a student is working
outside the Institute (e.g. working with an external co-supervisor) must register through
electronic means.
b. Registration process has two parts: Academic, and administrative and both must be
completed in order to complete the registration process. Academic registration includes
filling the registration form and specifying the courses that the student plans to do in
the semester and getting it approved. Administrative part includes paying all dues to
the Institute. A student who is working outside the Institute may get this completed
through a friend/adviser/etc.
10
c. A student shall normally register for courses if their course requirement conditions are
not fulfilled. A student may register for the courses and thesis simultaneously in a
semester. Thesis/Scholarly Paper registration will be in multiple "courses" of 4 credits
each (i.e. for 8 credits, a student will have to register for two thesis courses, each of 4
credits).
d. Online Courses: IIIT-Delhi has evolved a system for allowing students to take online
courses. Students can take advantage of the increasing amount of such courses made available
by reputed universities across the world to complement the courses offered in the institute.
PG students can do Online Courses under approved IP/IS credits of their specific
discipline/program and will be awarded regular grade (A to F) by the concerned
faculty supervisor.
(2) Pre-Registration of Courses
Pre-registration is necessary part of the academic registration for non-first semester
students. In case a student fails to do pre-registration of courses, a penalty may be imposed
if the student does not register his/her preference within the stipulated period.
(3) Late Registration
a. Late registration is permitted as per academic calendar on the payment of late
registration fee. The late fee may be waived if the delay is due to an academic activity
undertaken with prior permission. The number of days missed due to late arrival shall
be treated as leave of absence. A fee for late academic registration may be imposed.
(4) Adding or Dropping of Courses
a. A student can change the courses that he/she does in a semester by adding and dropping
courses till the last date for add/drop as specified in the academic calendar. In addition,
a student can drop, with permission from the Chair PG Affairs, some courses even
beyond the last date for add/drop, i.e. before the late drop date mentioned in the
academic calendar.
(5) Cancellation of registration
A student is solely responsible to ensure that all conditions for proper registration are
satisfied, and there are no timetable clashes. The registration may be cancelled by DOAA
for a course if any irregularity is found at a later stage. A student's registration for the
semester may be cancelled as part of disciplinary action. Leave beyond permissible limits
may also result in cancellation of registration for a semester.
(6) Summer term registration
11
Registration in the summer term is optional. But if a PG student is doing some academic
work, he/she is required to register. A PG student on financial plan of the Institute is
expected to remain in the Institute and work during the summer term even if he/she is not
registered, though he/she may take vacation as per rules. A student can register for up to 8
credits of which up to 4 credits can be for thesis work/IS.
(7) Registration of an Audit Course
A PG/Ph.D. student can be allowed to take a course as Audit on the condition that it will count
in the maximum course load for a semester but not in the calculation of CGPA. Further, the
faculty teaching the course will specify the requirements including attendance and a minimum
passing grade right in the beginning. The final grade for Audit course will, however, be ‘S" or
‘X'. A student having "X" grade in a audit course can do the course again as audit or credit.
However, a student having "S" grade in an audit course, cannot do the same course again.
9. Leave Rules
The students may be granted leave of absence on application to the AAC. The following
leaves are applicable:
(1) Vacation and casual leave
a. A post graduate student on financial assistance plan from the Institute may be allowed
vacation leave during any period of Institute's vacation or during the mid-semester
recess up to a maximum of 15 days per semester (six months), subject to a maximum
of 30 days at a time. Leave not availed in one semester may be carried over to the next
semester.
b. In addition, a student irrespective of the financial assistance may be allowed to go on casual
leave for up to 8 working days in a calendar year, with permission.
(2) On-Duty leave
a. A Ph.D. student may be granted on-duty leave for attending seminars, conferences,

(3) Summer leave
a. A PG student who is on financial assistance may be granted leave during the summer
vacation period for undertaking internships, projects etc. This will be "leave without
pay" and during this period, the student will not get the assistantship/scholarship.
Decision on such leave requests will be made by the AAC, which may not grant this
leave if it views that granting of the leave can hinder the completion of the PG program
of the student. All students taking such leave, must report for registration the next
semester, even if they do not have any course requirement next semester. Any
12
relaxation of this guideline will be decided by the AAC, and will be granted only on
academic grounds (e.g. a student is attending a conference).
(4) Semester leave
a. Semester leave may be granted to students by the AAC upon recommendations of the
supervisor on various accounts, including medical, for up to a maximum of two
semesters in the program. In the case of semester leave, the academic registration of
the student shall be cancelled for that semester. The financial assistance to students
shall also be not available during the period of semester leave. AnM.Tech. student
cannot avail semester leave for Internship during the first three regular semesters
(Monsoon and Winter) of the degree program. However, he/she may plan to graduate
by the end of the 3rd Semester for pursuing Internship in the 4th semester, after having
completed all the graduation requirements by the end of the 3rd semester.
b. When the total days of absence is more than 20 days in a semester, the student may be
required to take a semester leave.
(5) Medical leave

a. If a student decides to leave the program, he/she has to leave the program at the end of
the ongoing semester. The student has to inform the AAC and advisors in advance (at
least one month), complete the teaching duties, if any, return all the equipments and
data, and get signatures on the no-dues form
10. Working with Collaborators outside IIIT-Delhi
(1) A PG student may interact and work with an approved external co-supervisor in a
collaborating organization. Students shall require permission from the AAC to proceed to
work with the external co-supervisor. All students working with the external co-supervisor
shall be governed by the following guidelines during the period of absence from IIIT-Delhi.
13

through a regular video/audio conferencing or through regular reporting.
d. Such students are permitted to register as a non-degree/visiting student in an institute
other than IIIT-Delhi and may transfer the credit. Transfer of credits will be decided on
a case-by-case basis by the AAC. The students can also take course on audit and submit
the performance records for the consideration of waiver of course requirements if
desired.
e. They shall not be provided any financial assistance from the Institute during the period
they are with the external co-supervisor. Financial assistance during these periods shall
be provided by the collaborating institute as per their norms, or some other sources like
scholarships from agencies, etc.
(2) When working with collaborators outside the Institute, the IP rights will be as decided
between the supervisor(s), and the sponsoring agency, if any. Any such arrangement shall
be done with the concurrence of the AAC, and shall not interfere with the ability of the
student to write his/her thesis and publish results of the work.
11. Internship rules for M.Tech. students
An M.Tech. student may do a single 6-month internship during the course of his/her
program. The earliest that this internship can take place is during the 4thregular Semester
only. The internships for M.Tech. students will be allowed under the approved internship
rules available on IIITD website.
12. Teaching and Evaluation
(1) Teaching
a. As specified in the Regulations for B.Tech. Program
(2) Continuous evaluation
a. As specified in the Regulations for B.Tech. Program
14
(3) Grading scheme
a. One of the letter grades given in the following table shall be awarded to a student
reflecting his/her overall performance in a course. Each letter grade carries certain
points as given in the table, and these points are used in the computation of the
SGPA/CGPA as explained later.
b. In the academic courses, the final grades awarded are A to F (A+ is a grade with same
points as A, and is there to honor excellence).
c. An I (Incomplete) grade may be awarded in cases when all the requirements for a
course are not met by the student at the time of submission of grades, and it essentially
reflects an "incomplete" status in the ERP. For all courses including project based
courses this grade must be converted to a regular letter grade (A to F, S or X) within
one month of the end of the current term (moderation date). For courses other than
project / independent study, incomplete grade "I" is meant primarily for medical
reasons. All unconverted "I" grades are automatically converted to F grade after the
grade conversion deadline, which is one month after the moderation date
d. All courses in which a student obtains an F grade must be repeated or replaced by
another equivalent course.
e. Thesis/Scholarly Paper registration will be in multiple "courses" of 4 credits each ( i.e.
for 8 credits, a student will have to register for two thesis courses with the name

M.Tech. Thesis progress, M.Tech. Scholarly Paper progress, M.Tech Capstone Project
progress each of 4 credits) and S/X grades will be assigned to each of these. At the end
of the last semester, the student will register for 16 credits of M.Tech. Thesis and final
letter grade will be awarded at the end of Thesis defense for full 16 credits which will
be counted towards SGPA and CGPA. Similarly, for scholarly paper, student will
register for 4/8 credits of M.Tech. Scholarly Paper in the last semester and the final
letter grade will be awarded after the submission of SP report to the advisor. Further,
student's advisor(s) also has(have) to submit a report for student's progress to AAC.
(4) Performance Indicators - SGPA and CGPA
a. The semester performance is indicated by a Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)
which is a weighted sum of all the points earned in the courses done in a semester. The
SGPA is given for each semester and is computed using the following formula.
SGPA = (u1.w1 + u2.w2 + … + un.wn) / (u1 + u2 + … + un),
Where ui is the number of credits for the course i and wi is the points earned through
the letter grade in that course.
b. While doing the computation of SGPA, the course/thesis credits with grades S and X
are ignored.
c. The overall performance is indicated by a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)
which is computed in the same manner as the computation of SGPA but for all the
courses done in the program. While the F and X grades shall show on the grade sheet,
the original grade of a course repeated/replaced is ignored in the computation of CGPA.
d. ‘F' grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, however, it is counted in the
calculation of SGPA.
13. Minimum Academic Performance Requirements
(1) M.Tech. program
a. The minimum graduating CGPA is 6.5.
b. The minimum SGPA/CGPA for continuing in the program is 6.0. If the SGPA/CGPA
falls below this, the student may be placed under warning first, and if the performance
does not improve, may be asked to leave the program.
(2) Ph.D. program
a. The minimum graduating CGPA is 7.5.
16
b. The minimum continuing CGPA is 7.0. If the CGPA falls below this, he/she may be
asked to shift to M.Tech. program or leave.
c. If the SGPA in the first semester falls below 7, the student concerned will be issued a
warningby Academic Section.
14. Students under Warning
(1) A student who is under warning will normally not be entitled for two components of his
stipend - scholarship and assistantship. He/she will get only the sustenance portion. The
student will also not be allowed to be on any elected/nominated committee representing
students of the Institute, and if he is on any committee he/she shall resign.
15. Requirements for the M.Tech. Degree
(1) Per Semester Load Requirements
A normal full time load is 12 credits to 20 credits including the credits of OOPD, RM and
TAship. For the students doing TA duty, it will count as 4 credit load. A student may be
permitted an overload of at most 4 credits in a semester in 2rd and subsequent semesters if
he/she has CGPA>8.00. Students who have completed the stipulated course requirements
shall register for thesis or scholarly paper in multiple "courses" of 4 credits each (i.e. for 8
credits, a student will have to register for two thesis courses, each of 4 credits) and S/X
grades will be assigned to each of these. No overload shall be permitted in the thesis unit
registration. Part time students may register for any number of credits lesser than the
normal full-time load.
(2) Course Work Requirements
a. A student may do an M.Tech. with thesis or with scholarly paper or without ‘thesis and
scholarly paper'. In some programs, Thesis is a mandatory requirement for which
program specific regulations need to be referred. In with-thesis option, an M.Tech.
student must complete a minimum of 32 credits of course work. In the Scholarly Paper
option, the student must complete 40 or 44 credits (depending on the credits of the
Scholarly Paper). In without ‘thesis and scholarly paper' option, the student must
complete 48 credits of course work. The supervisor or the AAC may advise the students
with insufficient background to do additional course credits. In addition, students are
required to do some "refresher" modules for strengthening their background. These
modules will be reflected in the transcript.
17
For the students admitted in academic year 2018-19 onwards, the grades earned in the
`Summer refresher' courses will not be counted towards CGPA calculation and in 48
credits of degree requirements. However, summer refresher grades will reflect in the
transcript. The grades for `Object Oriented Programming' and `Research Methods' will
count towards CGPA and the credits for these courses will be over and above 48 credits
degree requirement.
b. An M.Tech. student must complete the core/bucket requirements for completion of
degree. He/she can replace upto two courses falling under the category of elective by
another elective and IS/IP by another IS/IP. Further, a core course grade can only be
replaced by a core course.
c. M.Tech. students can also repeat a course which they have already done for grade
improvement, in such cases best of the 2 grades will count towards the CGPA. An
M.Tech. student may also be allowed to do extra courses. All such permissions shall
be granted by the AAC upon requests from the students
(3) Thesis/Scholarly Paper credit and Total Credit requirements
a. For M.Tech. with-thesis, a student has to complete a minimum of 16 credits of thesis.
For M.Tech. with scholarly paper, he/she has to complete 4 or 8 credits of scholarly
paper. The total minimum credit requirements for an M.Tech. degree is 48 credits
(32+16 for M.Tech. with thesis, and 40+8 or 44+4 for M.Tech. with scholarly paper).
A M.Tech. student can also do M.Tech. without ‘Thesis and Scholarly Paper', i.e with
48 credits of course work. However, for some programs Thesis is a mandatory
requirement for which students are required to refer program specific requirements.
b. For the purpose of grading in the thesis/scholarly paper credits registered, the progress
in the thesis/scholarly paper work shall be assessed by the thesis supervisor(s). For each
semester, one S (if the performance is satisfactory) or one X (if the performance is not
satisfactory) grade shall be awarded by the thesis supervisor(s) to each of the registered
thesis/scholarly paper courses of 4 credit each. In the last semester a letter grade shall
be awarded for the complete 16 credits of Thesis/4 or 8 credits of Scholarly Paper.
(4) Thesis Option: Supervisor, Evaluation, and Defense
a. The M.Tech. Thesis shall be done under the guidance of thesis supervisor(s), who shall
be faculty member(s) of the Institute. A thesis may also have co-supervisors, who may
be Adjunct Faculty of the Institute, or external co-supervisors approved by the AAC.
18
b. An M.Tech. Thesis shall be evaluated by an evaluation committee which shall consist
of the supervisor(s), including co-supervisors, and two other non-supervisor examiners.
For a thesis, it is desirable to have one of the examiners from outside the Institute. The
committee must be approved by the AAC.
c. TheM.Tech. Thesis must be defended by the student in front of the thesis evaluation
committee. The defense should be held no earlier than one-week after the thesis has
been submitted (exceptions may be granted by Chair PG Affairs). The thesis evaluation
committee shall make its recommendation to the AAC.
d. For Scholarly paper the evaluation committee consists of only the Supervisor (s).
e. For Capstone project the evaluation committee consists of Supervisors which include
supervisor from industry/research lab. The grades for members in a team will be
decided by the supervisors of the project, based on their assessment of the work done
by the members, and the extent to which they have been able to meet the deliverables
(5) Scholarly Paper Option: Supervisor and Evaluation
a. A student doing M.Tech. with Scholarly Paper has multiple options for completing the
scholarly paper requirement: a regular scholarly paper and a capstone project.
b. Regular Scholarly Paper: The regular scholarly paper shall be done under the
guidance of a supervisor, who shall be a faculty member of the Institute. A scholarly
paper may also have co-supervisors, who may be Adjunct Faculty of the Institute, or
external co-supervisors approved by the AAC. For this scholarly paper, no defense is
required. It will be evaluated and signed by the supervisor(s) and the result along with
copy of Scholarly paper communicated to the Academic Administration.
c. Capstone Project: Scholarly paper can also be done through a capstone project. The
projects are usually defined by one or more faculty members who will act as
supervisors, but can include supervisors from industry or other academic institutions.
Students can undertake to do a project singly or in a team. The deliverables of the
project will be clearly specified by the supervisors, as will the grading scheme to be
adopted in meeting these deliverables. The grades for the students in the team will be
decided by the supervisors of the project, based on their assessment of the work
done/deliverables, and the project report. The grades along with a copy of project report
will be communicated to the Academic Administration.
(6) Award of degree
Upon a satisfactory report from the Dean, Academic Affairs, the Academic Senate may
recommend the award of the M.Tech. degree to the student. The default graduation date
for a M.Tech. student will be after completion of 2 years of the M.Tech. program. In case
19
a student completes his graduation requirements in 3 semesters and want to graduate with
an early date, he can request for the same. While pending the actual award of the degree
in a regular convocation of the Institute, the Dean of Academic Affairs may authorize the
Registrar to issue a provisional certificate to a student who completes the requirements for
graduation.
16. Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree
(1) General
A student shall be considered for the award of Ph.D. degree by the academic Senate only
upon the completion of the requirements mentioned here. Per semester load requirements
of Ph.D. students is same as for M.Tech. students. However, Ph.D. students who are on
assistantship may be given a relaxation of up to 8 credits in the normal full time load.
(2) Course Work Requirement
a. The requirement of the course work for a Ph.D. student is aimed at providing the basic
academic preparation to carry out the research, and have sufficient breadth in the area.
The minimum course requirement for a Ph.D. student is normally 32 credits for students
whose highest degree is a B.Tech. (or equivalent), and 16for those who have an
M.Tech. (or equivalent). A Ph.D. student need to complete this requirement only by
doing courses of 500 level or above. However, a Ph.D. student can take any 300 level
course for learning purpose. For a Ph.D. student taking on the way M.Tech. 300 level
course will count towards M.Tech. as per the clause mentioned in M.Tech. regulations.
After the course work, the student is expected to have sufficient breadth in at least three
of the main sub-areas of Computer Science. The AAC may ask the students with
insufficient background to do additional courses (in addition to 32/16 credits).

*This will not be counted to minimum credit requirement and may be waived for those who did a same course during their
B.Tech./M.Tech. program at IIITD
21
**This waiver in coursework may only be provided with the permission from the thesis advisor and the dissertation committee.
***500-level courses (or higher) will be considered towards the Ph.D. program. However, students may be allowed to take at most
two advanced undergraduate courses (300-level or higher) with the permission of the thesis advisor and AAC.
****The course work will include mandatory courses from Design and will be taken from a bucket defined by the DRC of the dept.
b. In special cases, for students with advance standing by virtue of their academic
preparedness and/or by virtue of their professional work experience, some of the course
requirements may be waived. All such waivers shall be decided upon by the AAC and
reported to the Senate.
c. A Ph.D. student may be permitted to replace up to two courses done by him/her and in
which he/she has obtained passing, but not good, grade. The replacement will be
permitted as and when the request is made by the concerned student after publication
of result provided it does not result in underload. In this case, the earlier course will be
listed in the transcript as having been taken on "Audit". He/She may also be permitted
to do extra courses to improve the CGPA. All such permissions shall be granted by the
AAC upon requests from the students.
(3) Transfer of Credits for Courses done Outside
a. Students may be permitted to do academic work and courses in places of repute outside
IIIT-Delhi. Based on their performance/quantum of work done and the content of the
course, the AAC may consider them equivalent to some course credits, and waive credit
requirements for similar courses/projects within IIIT-Delhi. Institutions with which
IIIT-Delhi has arrangements/MOU/student exchange programs, transfer of credits may
also be permitted. Any such waivers/transfer are permitted only if the courses being
considered have not been counted for any other degree/diploma requirement.
(4) Thesis credit requirements
a. All Ph.D. students irrespective of their entry category are expected to successfully
complete a minimum of 56 credits by thesis. In truly exceptional cases where the Ph.D.
candidate is ready with a thesis before he/she has accumulated these credits, the AAC
can consider waiving off some of these credits. For the purpose of grading in the thesis
credits registered, the progress in the thesis work shall be assessed by the thesis
supervisor(s). For each semester, one S (if the performance is satisfactory) or one X (if
the performance is not satisfactory) grade shall be awarded by the thesis supervisor(s).
The thesis grades shall be submitted by the thesis supervisor(s) at the end of the
semester.
22
Ph.D. students on completion of 5 years of registration will continue to do online
registration in the ERP and will present their progress of research work before the
monitoring committee till they submit the final thesis for evaluation.
(5) Thesis Supervisor and External Co-supervisor
a. The thesis work shall be done under the guidance of the Ph.D. supervisor, who shall be
a faculty member of the Institute. An adjunct faculty can also be a supervisor, with
permission of the AAC. There may be multiple supervisors. Normally, a student is
expected to decide the supervisor(s) by the start of the second semester but can defer it
till the end of second semester. This will be done by informing the AAC through a
form/letter, which shall be signed by the supervisor(s). A student can change the
supervisor later - for this a formal request will have to be submitted to AAC and has to
be signed by the old as well as the new supervisors.
b. A student may also have external co-supervisors for the thesis. Such external co-
supervisor shall be approved by the AAC upon a request by the student, duly approved
and forwarded by the supervisor(s). The request must be accompanied by the CV/Bio
or sufficient information about the proposed external co-supervisor which will allow
the AAC to evaluate the suitability. Normally, the external co-supervisor should be
finalized before the comprehensive and the AAC should be informed by the adviser
and the student about the same.
c. Change of Supervisor at a late stage: If the change of supervisor happens at a late stage
when some research has been already done, the request should be considered as per below
guidelines available at Annexure I.
(6) Monitoring Committee and Yearly Review / Yearly Seminar
a. The AAC shall form a monitoring committee for each candidate, whose task will be to
independently monitor and report on the progress of the candidate. The committee
should generally be formed before the end of the candidate's second semester in the
program and should consist of at least three faculty members/experts.
b. The monitoring committee shall submit its evaluation about the progress of the candidate,
at least once a year. If the monitoring committee feels that the candidate is not making
sufficient progress, it may recommend suitable actions to be taken, including
recommending that the student leave the Ph.D. program or migrate to M.Tech., as given in
6(3). This review may be done by requiring the Ph.D. students to make presentations about
their progress, or through some other method.
23
(7) Comprehensive
The aim of the comprehensive examination is to check the understanding of the Ph.D.
student about his/her area of research. (Though a comprehensive traditionally was meant
to check that the student has sufficient breadth, the Institute feels that this type of breadth
requirement should be fulfilled through courses, and the comprehensive should be used to
test the "comprehension" of the candidate about his/her main area of research.) For the
comprehensive, the student shall present a complete literature survey (much on the lines of
papers in ACM Surveys), research proposal and research plan on his/her area of work. The
survey report will be submitted to the committee formed for the comprehensive exam by
the AAC. The student will present a seminar on the above. The seminar should be open for
all to attend. After the seminar, the committee may examine the student further and will
submit its report regarding the outcome of the comprehensive to the AAC. If the student
fails the examination, he/she is allowed an additional half a semester (i.e. 3 months) to
retry.
A student is expected to complete his/her comprehensive examination as per the following
timeline:

(8) Regular Seminars / Yearly Review
This requirement for regular seminar or a yearly review is moved to item (6).
(9) Teaching Requirements
a. One of the potential career options for the research students is academics. The Ph.D.
program at IIIT-Delhi aims to develop suitable teaching skills among the research
students through teaching requirements. Towards this, it requires all students on
financial assistantship plan of the Institute are required to take part in the teaching
activities.
b. All Ph.D. students must be TA for at least two semesters to satisfy the teaching
requirements for a Ph.D. degree. Students on research assistantship will also be
required to complete this requirement, though they may be assigned lighter load each
semester. The feedback received from the course students on the TA work will be part
of the Ph.D. student record, and will be an input in evaluation.
c. Below are the TA rules
1) A Ph.D. student getting institute fellowship for full duration of Ph.D. is required to
do TA duty for 8 semesters
2) A Ph.D. student who is RA (throughout) is required to do TA duty for a minimum of
two semesters
Institute support for 1st year followed by Project support
for the remaining duration - 2 TA duty must
Institute support for 1stand 2ndyear followed by Project
Support for the remaining duration - 4 TA duty must
Institute support for 1st, 2ndand 3rdyear followed by Project
Support for the remaining duration - 6 TA duty must
Institute support for 1st, 2nd, 3rdand 4th year followed by
Project Support for the remaining duration - 6 TA duty must
25
Institute support till 9th Semester followed by Project
Support for the remaining duration - 7 TA duty must
TA duty to be done in the first 4 years.
If a student has not done the required TA duty, TA portion of the stipend shall be
deducted.
d. Students will be assigned their TA duties towards the end of a regular semester for
courses in the next semester. During the break, they should prepare themselves for the
course, and with help from the instructor, design the assignments, develop the solutions
and grading of the assignments. They will also be involved in the grading of the exam
papers and developing the solutions to the exam papers. Senior students are also
encouraged to be a tutor as well as take part in the class room teaching, along with the
corresponding instructors. Such arrangements are to be worked out between the
instructor in-charge of the course and the student. It is expected that the load of TA
work in a semester will be similar to that of a course, that is, approximately 10 hours
per week.
e. The teaching requirement may be waived for part-time and/or sponsored candidates (as
their professional goals are likely to be already defined.)
(10) Thesis submission, Evaluation and Defense
Each Ph.D. student is expected to write a thesis report on the Ph.D. work. The thesis
has to be submitted by the student for evaluation. Guidelines for Ph.D. thesis evaluation
are given separately.
(11) Award of degree
a. Upon acceptance of the revised thesis by the AAC, the Chairman, Senate may recommend
the award of the Ph.D. degree to the student. While pending the actual award of the
degree in a regular convocation of the Institute, the Chairman, Senate may also authorize
the Registrar to issue a provisional certificate to a student who completes the
requirements for graduation.
The date on the degree shall be as follows:
 June 21 for the students who finish their requirements during the winter semester
(e.g. 4th semester of M.Tech.)
26
 Sep 21 for those who finish the requirements during summer term.
 Jan 21 for those who finish the requirement during the Monsoon semester
17. Prizes and Medals/Awards at Graduation
a. The academic Senate of the institute can set up awards, prizes, medals etc. to be given to
deserving students at graduation time.
b. Under exceptional circumstances, where gross violation of the conditions of the
awards/recognition or academic misconduct is detected at a later stage, the Senate may
recommend to the Board of Governors to withdraw the award and recognition
18. Disciplinary Action Framework
IIIT-Delhi maintains global academic standards in its own education system. Therefore, it
does not tolerate any form of indiscipline/ academic dishonesty. Action will be taken
against students found engaging in acts of indiscipline/ academic dishonesty by
Disciplinary Action Committee (DAC) constituted by the Director. The disciplinary action
may result in semester/year/two year drop or even expulsion from the Institute. Separate
rules and regulations have been formulated to handle the cases of violations.
19. Migration from B.Tech. to Dual Degree Program
A B.Tech. student can opt to migrate to dual degree program of the institute any time before
the last date of Add/Drop of his/her 7th semester of the B.Tech. program. Eligibility criteria
for this and regulations for the dual degree program are given separately.
20. Power to Modify
Notwithstanding all that has been stated above, the Senate has the right to modify any of
the above regulations from time to time.

Annexure I
Guidelines for change of Supervisor (Refer para 15(5),c-above)
Guiding Ph.D. students by a supervisor is one of the longest and strongest associations between a
student and faculty. It is based on mutual trust and respect, in which a student expects the
supervisor to protect his/her interests, and supervisor expects high quality research work. While
change of supervisor at early stages is not uncommon and there is a standard process for it,
sometimes, due to various reasons, the student-supervisor relationship is formally terminated even
at a late stage. This note aims to provide some guidelines if the change of supervisor happens at a
late stage when some research has been already done. The guidelines are based on:

It will be assumed that all research work done by the student and supervisor before the
termination of student-supervisor relationship was being done towards the Ph.D. thesis of the
student, unless both agree for some work that it was done for some other purposes and was not
meant to be included in the thesis.

Rights of supervisor and student regarding authorship and publications, and rights of
supervisor for using the past-works (e.g. for building upon it, using as project deliverables, having
another student work on it, etc) and of student for using the past-works (e.g. towards his/her Ph.D.
degree) should be protected.
Guidelines
A. Change of supervisor at a late stage of the student's Ph.D. should be avoided and all
attempts should be made to take the relationship to its logical conclusion - namely
submission of the thesis. The possibility of having the past supervisor continue as a co-
supervisor should also be explored. Change of supervisor at a late stage should happen
only as the last resort.
B. If the student continues in the Institute with some other supervisor and does not want to
use previous work (e.g., start on a new problem), then this is like the normal change of
supervisor, which can follow existing process.
C. If the student continues in the Institute with some other supervisor and wishes to use
some of the past works in his/her thesis, the following steps will be taken:
a. A meeting shall be called between the previous supervisor, new supervisor and
the student. They may invite any other faculty member as well. If they can reach
an agreement on use of previous work and role of previous supervisor (including,
for example, him/her remaining as a co-supervisor without being an examiner for
the thesis), that agreement will be recorded and followed.
b. If the meeting does not result in any agreement, then in the final thesis certificate,
contribution of the previous supervisor will be explicitly recorded (e.g., it may be
stated that Prof. X was supervisor from date1 to date2, and Prof. Y from date2). If
31
the previous work included in the thesis is substantial, the previous supervisor can
also ask to be a co-supervisor, without any administrative rights and without
being an examiner for the PhD thesis.
D. If the student leaves the Institute, and wishes to use past work in his/her thesis and
continue with some supervisor in another university/institute, he/she may seek permission
through the new university/institute for use of these works. Institute will take a view
based on IP protection and approval of the previous supervisor.
E. If the supervisor leaves the Institute, then possibility of him/her continuing as a
supervisor or co-supervisor should be explored. If such an arrangement is not possible or
fails for any reason, the student can use the previous work in the thesis. In this case, it
will be explicitly recorded in the final thesis certificate that the outgoing faculty member
was the supervisor from Date1 to Date2.
F. Other cases not covered by the above, or any exceptions to the above, or any disputes in
implementing these guidelines, will be brought to the PGC, which will advise the Senate,
which will take the final view.

shall be made by the student along with the supporting documents. After evaluation of
the requests, the PG committee may approve the change. The credits for the courses and
thesis shall be transferred to the new program. The change shall not be permitted if the
academic performance in the old program is not good enough for continuation in the new
program. After the changes, the rules for the new program shall be applicable.
(2) A Ph.D. student can change his/her program to M.Tech.. If this change is done by a
student, he/she will be treated as being in the M.Tech. program from the start of his/her
program, and will have to refund the difference in fees and stipend between the Ph.D. and
M.Tech. programs, if any.
(3) If a Ph.D. student fails two reviews, then the PGC may propose either that he or she
leaves the institute; or enroll in the M.Tech. program. If the latter, then usually full
M.Tech. fees would be payable by the student, along with any differences in stipends. In
some cases, the stipend difference may be reduced, waived or deferred on case by case
basis.
A warning letter will be issued by the Academic Section to students when they fail the
first review which should also explain the above.
(4) In special cases when a Ph.D. thesis is not found suitable for Ph.D., the candidate can
convert to M.Tech. and resubmit the thesis with suitable enhancements for M.Tech. (and
ensure that other requirements are met). In such a case, repaying of difference in stipends
and fees may be waived. Students enrolled in all those disciplines in which the institute
does not currently offers Masters program, if a student fails his or her comprehensive
exam or the Ph.D. thesis is not found suitable, migration to a different program is not
possible.
(5) An M.Tech. student can change his/her program, if permitted, to Ph.D. and continue to do
the course/research work to enable him/her to meet the requirements of the Ph.D. degree.
9
Only students with CGPA >8.00 and who have completed minimum of 2 semesters and
20 credits in M.Tech. program will be eligible to apply for the change to Ph.D. program.
The student will be eligible for Ph.D. stipend only from the time he/she is approved for
enrollment as the Ph.D. student. Such a student, for Ph.D. credit requirement, may be
treated as if he/she had joined the Ph.D. program from the start of the PG (here, M.Tech)
program. The student may be granted an M.Tech. degree also, provided he/she fulfils all
the academic requirements for the same. Such a student may also be refunded his/her
M.Tech. tuition fee, if he/she successfully completes the Ph.D. program.
7. Ph.D. Student getting an M.Tech.
A student admitted in the Ph.D. program after a B.Tech. can obtain an M.Tech. degree "on
the way" provided he/she completes the academic requirements for the same. For this:
 Courses done for Ph.D. can count towards the M.Tech. degree.
 Work done in the Scholarly Paper or M.Tech. thesis cannot be included in the Ph.D.
thesis.
 A Ph.D. student can apply for an M.Tech. degree only after completing the
Comprehensive examination and after spending at least five semesters in the Institute.
 If a Ph.D. student who obtains an M.Tech. degree and leaves the Institute without
completing his/her Ph.D., he/she will be considered as having changed his program
from Ph.D. to M.Tech. (and will have to refund the difference between stipend and
fees as per rules.)
 Courses such as Summer Refresher Courses will be waived off for such students.
 If
OOPD/AP
and
RM
are
taken
by
the
student
either
during
the
B.Tech./M.Tech./Ph.D. in IIITD, they are not required to complete these courses
again.
8. Registration
(1) General
a. All Postgraduate students, full time as well as part time, are required to register each
regular semester, unless they are on approved leave of absence. If a student is
working outside the Institute (e.g. working with an external co-supervisor) must
register through electronic means.
b. Registration process has two parts: Academic, and administrative and both must be
completed in order to complete the registration process. Academic registration
includes filling the registration form and specifying the courses that the student plans
to do in the semester and getting it approved. Administrative part includes paying all
10
dues to the Institute. A student who is working outside the Institute may get this
completed through a friend/adviser/etc,
c. A student shall normally register for courses if their course requirement conditions
are not fulfilled. A student may register for the courses and thesis simultaneously in a
semester. Thesis/Scholarly Paper registration will be in multiple "courses" of 4
credits each (i.e. for 8 credits, a student will have to register for two thesis courses,
each of 4 credits).
d. Online Courses: IIIT-Delhi has evolved a system for allowing students to take online
courses. Students can take advantage of the increasing amount of such courses made
available by reputed universities across the world to complement the courses offered in the
institute.
PG students can do Online Courses under approved IP/IS credits of their specific
discipline/program and will be awarded regular grade (A to F) by the concerned
faculty supervisor.
(2) Pre-Registration of Courses
Pre-registration is necessary part of the academic registration for non-first semester
students. In case a student fails to do pre-registration of courses, a penalty may be
imposed if the student does not register his/her preference within the stipulated period.
(3) Late Registration
a. Late registration is permitted as per academic calendar on the payment of late
registration fee. The late fee may be waived if the delay is due to an academic activity
undertaken with prior permission. The number of days missed due to late arrival shall
be treated as leave of absence. A fee for late academic registration may be imposed.
(4) Adding or Dropping of Courses
a. A student can change the courses that he/she does in a semester by adding and
dropping courses till the last date for add/drop as specified in the academic calendar.
In addition, a student can drop, with permission from the PG Chair, some courses
even beyond the last date for add/drop, i.e. before the late drop date mentioned in the
academic calendar.
(5) Cancellation of registration
A student is solely responsible to ensure that all conditions for proper registration are
satisfied, and there are no timetable clashes. The registration may be cancelled by DOAA
for a course if any irregularity is found at a later stage. A student‟s registration for the
semester may be cancelled as part of disciplinary action. Leave beyond permissible limits
may also result in cancellation of registration for a semester.
11
(6) Summer term registration
Registration in the summer term is optional. But if a PG student is doing some academic
work, he/she is required to register. A PG student on financial plan of the Institute is
expected to remain in the Institute and work during the summer term even if he/she is not
registered, though he/she may take vacation as per rules. A student may register for up to
8 credits of which up to 4 credits may be for thesis work/IS.
(7) Registration of an Audit Course
A PG/Ph.D. student can be allowed to take a course as Audit on the condition that it will
count in the maximum course load for a semester but not in the calculation of CGPA.
Further, the faculty teaching the course will specify the requirements including attendance
and a minimum passing grade right in the beginning. The final grade for Audit course will,
however, be „S" or „X‟.
9. Leave Rules
The students may be granted leave of absence on application to the PG committee. The
following leaves are applicable:
(1) Vacation and casual leave
a. A post graduate student on financial assistance plan from the Institute may be allowed
vacation leave during any period of Institute‟s vacation or during the mid-semester
recess up to a maximum of 15 days per semester (six months), subject to a maximum
of 30 days at a time. Leave not availed in one semester may be carried over to the
next semester.
b. In addition, a student irrespective of the financial assistance may be allowed to go on casual
leave for up to 8 working days in a calendar year, with permission.
(2) On-Duty leave
a. A Ph.D. student may be granted on-duty leave for attending seminars, conferences,

his/her supervisor as well as the PG Committee.
(3) Summer leave
a. A PG student who is on financial assistance may be granted leave during the summer
vacation period for undertaking internships, projects etc. This will be "leave without
pay" and during this period, the student will not get the assistantship/scholarship.
Decision on such leave requests will be made by the PG committee, which may not
grant this leave if it views that granting of the leave can hinder the completion of the
PG program of the student. All students taking such leave, must report for registration
12
the next semester, even if they do not have any course requirement next semester.
Any relaxation of this guideline will be decided by the PG committee, and will be
granted only on academic grounds (e.g. a student is attending a conference).
(4) Semester leave
a. Semester leave may be granted to students by the PG committee upon
recommendations of the supervisor on various accounts, including medical, for up to
a maximum of two semesters in the program. In the case of semester leave, the
academic registration of the student shall be cancelled for that semester. The financial
assistance to students shall also be not available during the period of semester leave.
A student cannot avail semester leave for Internship during the first four regular
semesters (Monsoon and Winter) of the degree program. However, he/she may plan
to graduate by the end of the Monsoon semester (5th semester) by pursuing Internship
in the 5th semester, even after having completed all the graduation requirements by
the end of the 4th semester.
b. When the total days of absence is more than 20 days in a semester, the student may be
required to take a semester leave.

of the ongoing semester. The student has to inform the PGC and advisors in advance
(at least one month), complete the teaching duties, if any, return all the equipments
and data, and get signatures on the no-dues form
10. Working with Collaborators outside IIIT-Delhi
(1) A PG student may interact and work with an approved external co-supervisor in a
collaborating organization. Students shall require permission from the PGC to proceed to
13
work with the external co-supervisor. All students working with the external co-

b. In the academic courses, the final grades awarded are A to F (A+ is a grade with same
points as A, and is there to honor excellence).
c. An I (Incomplete) grade may be awarded in cases when all the requirements for a
course are not met by the student at the time of submission of grades, and it
essentially reflects an "incomplete" status in the ERP. For all courses including
project based courses this grade must be converted to a regular letter grade (A to F, S
or X) within one month of the end of the current term(moderation date). For courses
other than project / independent study, incomplete grade "I" is meant primarily for
medical reasons. All unconverted "I" grades are automatically converted to F grade
after the grade conversion deadline, which is one month after the moderation date
d. All courses in which a student obtains an F grade must be repeated or replaced by
another equivalent course.
e. Thesis/Scholarly Paper registration will be in multiple "courses" of 4 credits each (
i.e. for 8 credits, a student will have to register for two thesis courses, each of 4
credits) and S/X grades will be assigned to each of these. At the end, during the last

credits in the last semester and the final letter grade will be awarded after the
submission of SP report to the advisor. Further, student‟s advisor(s) also has(have) to
submit a report for student‟s progress to PGC.
(4) Performance Indicators - SGPA and CGPA
a. The semester performance is indicated by a Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)
which is a weighted sum of all the points earned in the courses done in a semester.
The SGPA is given for each semester and is computed using the following formula.
SGPA = (u1.w1 + u2.w2 + … + un.wn) / (u1 + u2 + … + un),
Where ui is the number of credits for the course i and wi is the points earned through
the letter grade in that course.
b. While doing the computation of SGPA, the course/thesis credits with grades S and X
are ignored.
c. The overall performance is indicated by a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)
which is computed in the same manner as the computation of SGPA but for all the
courses done in the program. While the F and X grades shall show on the grade sheet,
the original grade of a course repeated/replaced is ignored in the computation of
CGPA.
d. „F‟ grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, however, it is counted in
the calculation of SGPA.
12. Minimum Academic Performance Requirements
(1) M.Tech. program
a. The minimum graduating CGPA is 6.5.
b. The minimum SGPA/CGPA for continuing in the program is 6.0. If the SGPA/CGPA
falls below this, the student may be placed under warning first, and if the performance
does not improve, may be asked to leave the program.
(2) Ph.D. program
a. The minimum graduating CGPA is 7.5.
b. The minimum continuing CGPA is 7.0. If the CGPA falls below this, he/she may be
asked to shift to M.Tech. program or leave.
16
c. If the SGPA in the first semester falls below 7, the student concerned will be issued a
warning by Academic Section.
13. Students under Warning
(1) A student who is under warning will normally not be entitled for two components of his
stipend - scholarship and assistantship. He/she will get only the sustenance portion. The
student will also not be allowed to be on any elected/nominated committee representing
students of the Institute, and if he is on any committee he/she shall resign.
14. Requirements for the M.Tech. Degree
(1) Per Semester Load Requirements
A normal full time load is 12 credits to 20 credits including the credits of OOPD, RM and
TAship. For the students doing TA duty, it will count as 4 credit load. A student may be
permitted an overload of at most 4 credits in a semester in 2rd and subsequent semesters if
he/she has CGPA>8.00. Students who have completed the stipulated course requirements
shall register for thesis or scholarly paper in multiple "courses" of 4 credits each (i.e. for
8 credits, a student will have to register for two thesis courses, each of 4 credits) and S/X
grades will be assigned to each of these. No overload shall be permitted in the thesis unit
registration. Part time students may register for any number of credits lesser than the
normal full-time load.
(2) Course Work Requirements
a. A student may do an M.Tech. with thesis or with scholarly paper or without „thesis
and scholarly paper‟. In some programs, Thesis is a mandatory requirement for which
program specific regulations need to be referred. In with-thesis option, an M.Tech.
student must complete a minimum of 32 credits of course work. In the Scholarly
Paper option, the student must complete 40 or 44 credits (depending on the credits of
the Scholarly Paper). In without „thesis and scholarly paper‟ option, the student must
complete 48 credits of course work. The supervisor or the PGC may advise the
students with insufficient background to do additional course credits. In addition,
students are required to do some "refresher" modules for strengthening their
background. These modules will be reflected in the transcript.
For the students admitted in academic year 2018-19 onwards, the grades earned in the
`Summer refresher‟ courses will not be counted towards CGPA calculation and in 48
credits of degree requirements. However, summer refresher grades will reflect in the
17
transcript. The grades for `Object Oriented Programming‟ and `Research Methods‟
will count towards CGPA and the credits for these courses will be over and above 48
credits degree requirement.
b. An M.Tech. student must complete the core/bucket requirements for completion of
degree. He/she can replace upto two courses falling under the category of elective by
another elective and IS/IP by another IS/IP. Further, a core course grade can only be
replaced by a core course.
c. M.Tech. students can also repeat a course which they have already done for grade
improvement, in such cases best of the 2 grades will count towards the CGPA. An
M.Tech. student may also be allowed to do extra courses. All such permissions shall
be granted by the PG committee upon requests from the students
(3) Thesis/Scholarly Paper credit and Total Credit requirements
a. For M.Tech. with-thesis, a student has to complete a minimum of 16 credits of thesis.
For M.Tech. with scholarly paper, he/she has to complete 4 or 8 credits of scholarly
paper. The total minimum credit requirements for an M.Tech. .degree is 48 credits
(32+16 for M.Tech. with thesis, and 40+8 or 44+4 for M.Tech. with scholarly paper ).
A M.Tech. student can also do M.Tech. without „Thesis and Scholarly Paper‟, i.e
with 48 credits of course work. However, for some programs Thesis is a mandatory
requirement for which students are required to refer program specific requirements.
b. For the purpose of grading in the thesis/scholarly paper credits registered, the
progress in the thesis/scholarly paper work shall be assessed by the thesis
supervisor(s). For each semester, one S (if the performance is satisfactory) or one X
(if the performance is not satisfactory) grade shall be awarded by the thesis
supervisor(s) to each of the registered thesis/scholarly paper courses of 4 credit each.
In the last semester a letter grade shall be awarded for the complete 16 credits of
Thesis/4 or 8 credits of Scholarly Paper.
(4) Thesis Option: Supervisor, Evaluation, and Defense
a. The M.Tech.thesis shall be done under the guidance of thesis supervisor(s), who shall
be faculty member(s) of the Institute. A thesis may also have co-supervisors, who
may be Adjunct Faculty of the Institute, or external co-supervisors approved by the
PG Committee.
b. An M.Tech. thesis shall be evaluated by an evaluation committee which shall consist
of the supervisor(s), including co-supervisors, and two other non-supervisor
18
examiners. For a thesis, it is desirable to have one of the examiners from outside the
Institute. The committee must be approved by the PG Committee.
c. The M.Tech. thesis must be defended by the student in front of the thesis evaluation
committee. The defense should be held no earlier than one-week after the thesis has
been submitted (exceptions may be granted by PG Committee Chair). The thesis
evaluation committee shall make its recommendation to the PGC.
d. For Scholarly paper the evaluation committee consists of only the Supervisor (s).
e. For Capstone project the evaluation committee consists of Supervisors which include
supervisor from industry/research lab. The grades for members in a team will be
decided by the supervisors of the project, based on their assessment of the work done
by the members, and the extent to which they have been able to meet the deliverables
(5) Scholarly Paper Option: Supervisor and Evaluation
a. A student doing M.Tech. with Scholarly Paper has multiple options for completing
the scholarly paper requirement: a Regular Scholarly Paper and a Capstone Project.
b. Regular Scholarly Paper: The regular scholarly paper shall be done under the
guidance of a supervisor, who shall be a faculty member of the Institute. A scholarly
paper may also have co-supervisors, who may be Adjunct Faculty of the Institute, or
external co-supervisors approved by the PG Committee. For this scholarly paper, no
defense is required. It will be evaluated and signed by the supervisor(s) and the result
along with copy of Scholarly paper communicated to the Academic Administration.
c. Capstone Project: Scholarly paper can also be done through a capstone project. The
projects are usually defined by one or more faculty members who will act as
supervisors, but can include supervisors from industry or other academic institutions.
Students can undertake to do a project singly or in a team. The deliverables of the
project will be clearly specified by the supervisors, as will the grading scheme to be
adopted in meeting these deliverables. The grades for the students in the team will be
decided by the supervisors of the project, based on their assessment of the work
done/deliverables, and the project report. The grades along with a copy of project
report will be communicated to the Academic Administration.
(6) Award of degree
Upon a satisfactory report from the Dean, Academic Affairs, the Academic Senate may
recommend the award of the M.Tech. degree to the student. While pending the actual
award of the degree in a regular convocation of the Institute, the Dean of Academic
Affairs may authorize the Registrar to issue a provisional certificate to a student who
completes the requirements for graduation.
19
15. Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree
(1) General
A student shall be considered for the award of Ph.D. degree by the academic Senate only
upon the completion of the requirements mentioned here. Per semester load requirements
of Ph.D. students is same as for M.Tech. students. However, Ph.D. students who are on
assistantship may be given a relaxation of up to 8 credits in the normal full time load.
(2) Course Work Requirement
a. The requirement of the course work for a Ph.D. student is aimed at providing the
basic academic preparation to carry out the research, and have sufficient breadth in
the area. The minimum course requirement for a Ph.D. student is normally 32 credits
for students whose highest degree is a B.Tech. (or equivalent), and 16 for those who
have an M.Tech. (or equivalent). After the course work, the student is expected to
have sufficient breadth in at least three of the main sub-areas of Computer Science.
The PG committee may ask the students with insufficient background to do additional

credits will be divided as 16 credits for
Courses and 16 credits for Ph.D. level
research seminar style classes (where
research papers are intensively discussed by
the course instructor). Students are
encouraged to actively audit any related
courses other than those expected for credit
coursework with the permission of the thesis
adviser.
(ii). The student is expected to have
published in well reputed national/
international journals and presented at well
reputed national/ international conferences.
In case of book chapters, the expectation is
to have published them with well-reputed
international publishers such as Sage/Wiley
etc. The thesis advisor and the PGC will judge
the nature and the prestige of the
conferences/book publishers.

*This will not be counted to minimum credit requirement and may be waived for those who did a same course during their
B.Tech./M.Tech. program at IIITD
**This waiver in coursework may only be provided with the permission from the thesis advisor and the dissertation committee.
***500-level courses (or higher) will be considered towards the Ph.D. program. However, students may be allowed to take at most
two advanced undergraduate courses (300-level or higher) with the permission of the thesis advisor and PGC.
****The course work will include mandatory courses from Design and will be taken from a bucket defined by the DRC of the dept.
21
b. In special cases, for students with advance standing by virtue of their academic
preparedness and/or by virtue of their professional work experience, some of the
course requirements may be waived. All such waivers shall be decided upon by the
PG Committee and reported to the Senate.
c. A Ph.D. student may be permitted to replace up to two courses done by him/her and
in which he/she has obtained passing, but not good, grade. The replacement will be
permitted as and when the request is made by the concerned student after publication
of result provided it does not result in underload. In this case, the earlier course will
be listed in the transcript as having been taken on "Audit". He/She may also be
permitted to do extra courses to improve the CGPA. All such permissions shall be
granted by the PG committee upon requests from the students.
(3) Transfer of Credits for Courses done Outside
a. Students may be permitted to do academic work and courses in places of repute
outside IIIT-Delhi. Based on their performance/quantum of work done and the
content of the course, the PG committee may consider them equivalent to some
course credits, and waive credit requirements for similar courses/projects within IIIT-
Delhi. Institutions with which IIIT-Delhi has arrangements/MOU/student exchange
programs, transfer of credits may also be permitted. Any such waivers/transfer is
permitted only if the courses being considered have not been counted for any other
degree/diploma requirement.
(4) Thesis credit requirements
a. All Ph.D. students irrespective of their entry category are expected to successfully
complete a minimum of 56 credits by thesis. In truly exceptional cases where the
Ph.D. candidate is ready with a thesis before he/she has accumulated these credits, the
PG committee can consider waiving off some of these credits. For the purpose of
grading in the thesis credits registered, the progress in the thesis work shall be
assessed by the thesis supervisor(s). For each semester, one S (if the performance is
satisfactory) or one X (if the performance is not satisfactory) grade shall be awarded
by the thesis supervisor(s). The thesis grades shall be submitted by the thesis
supervisor(s) at the end of the semester.
Ph.D. students on completion of 5 years of registration will continue to do online
registration in the ERP and will present their progress of research work before the
monitoring committee till they submit the final thesis for evaluation.
22
(5) Thesis Supervisor and External Co-supervisor
a. The thesis work shall be done under the guidance of the Ph.D. supervisor, who shall
be a faculty member of the Institute. An adjunct faculty can also be a supervisor, with
permission of the PGC. There may be multiple supervisors. Normally, a student is
expected to decide the supervisor(s) by the start of the second semester but can defer
it till the end of second semester .This will be done by informing the PG Committee
through a form/letter, which shall be signed by the supervisor(s). A student can
change the supervisor later - for this a formal request will have to be submitted to PG
Committee and has to be signed by the old as well as the new supervisors.
b. A student may also have external co-supervisors for the thesis. Such external co-
supervisor shall be approved by the PG Committee upon a request by the student,
duly approved and forwarded by the supervisor(s). The request must be accompanied
by the CV/Bio or sufficient information about the proposed external co-supervisor
which will allow the PGC to evaluate the suitability. Normally, the external co-
supervisor should be finalized before the comprehensive and the PGC should be
informed by the adviser and the student about the same.
c. Change of Supervisor at a late stage: If the change of supervisor happens at a late stage
when some research has been already done, the request should be considered as per below
guidelines available at Annexure I.
(6) Monitoring Committee and Yearly Review / Yearly Seminar
a. The PG Committee shall form a monitoring committee for each candidate, whose task
will be to independently monitor and report on the progress of the candidate. The
committee should generally be formed before the end of the candidate‟s second
semester in the program and should consist of at least three faculty members/experts.
b. The monitoring committee shall submit its evaluation about the progress of the candidate,
at least once a year. If the monitoring committee feels that the candidate is not making
sufficient progress, it may recommend suitable actions to be taken, including
recommending that the student leave the Ph.D. program or migrate to M.Tech., as given
in 6(3). This review may be done by requiring the Ph.D. students to make presentations
about their progress, or through some other method.
23
(7) Comprehensive
The aim of the comprehensive examination is to check the understanding of the Ph.D.
studentabout his/her area of research. (Though a comprehensive traditionally was meant
to check that the student has sufficient breadth, the Institute feels that this type of breadth
requirement should be fulfilled through courses, and the comprehensive should be used to
test the "comprehension" of the candidate about his/her main area of research.) For the
comprehensive, the student shall present a complete literature survey (much on the lines
of papers in ACM Surveys), research proposal and research plan on his/her area of work.
The survey report will be submitted to the committee formed for the comprehensive
exam by the PG Committee. The student will present a seminar on the above. The
seminar should be open for all to attend. After the seminar, the committee may examine
the student further and will submit its report regarding the outcome of the comprehensive
to the PG Committee. If the student fails the examination, he/she is allowed an additional
half a semester ( i.e. 3 months) to retry.
A student is expected to complete his/her comprehensive examination as per the
following timeline:
Sl.No. Category of Ph.D. Student

(8) Regular Seminars / Yearly Review
This requirement for regular seminar or a yearly review is moved to item (6).
(9) Teaching Requirements
a. One of the potential career options for the research students is academics. The Ph.D.
program at IIIT-Delhi aims to develop suitable teaching skills among the research
students through teaching requirements. Towards this, it requires all students on
financial assistantship plan of the Institute are required to take part in the teaching
activities.
b. All Ph.D. students must be TA for at least two semesters to satisfy the teaching
requirements for a Ph.D. degree. Students on research assistantship will also be
required to complete this requirement, though they may be assigned lighter load each
semester. The feedback received from the course students on the TA work will be
part of the Ph.D. student record, and will be an input in evaluation.
c. Below are the TA rules
1) A Ph.D. student getting institute fellowship for full duration of Ph.D. is required to
do TA duty for 8 semesters
2) A Ph.D. student who is RA ( throughout) is required to do TA duty for a minimum
of two semesters
Institute support for 1st year followed by Project support
for the remaining duration - 2 TA duty must
Institute support for 1stand 2ndyear followed by Project
Support for the remaining duration - 4 TA duty must
Institute support for 1st, 2ndand 3rd year followed by Project
Support for the remaining duration - 6 TA duty must
Institute support for 1st, 2nd, 3rdand 4th year followed by
Project Support for the remaining duration - 6 TA duty must
25
Institute support till 9th Semester followed by Project
Support for the remaining duration - 7 TA duty must
TA duty to be done in the first 4 years.
If a student has not done the required TA duty, TA portion of the stipend shall be
deducted.
d. Students will be assigned their TA duties towards the end of a regular semester for
courses in the next semester. During the break, they should prepare themselves for the
course, and with help from the instructor, design the assignments, develop the
solutions and grading of the assignments. They will also be involved in the grading of
the exam papers and developing the solutions to the exam papers. Senior students are
also encouraged to be a tutor as well as take part in the class room teaching, along
with the corresponding instructors. Such arrangements are to be worked out between
the instructor in-charge of the course and the student. It is expected that the load of
TA work in a semester will be similar to that of a course, that is, approximately 10
hours per week.
e. The teaching requirement may be waived for part-time and/or sponsored candidates
(as their professional goals are likely to be already defined.)
(10) Thesis submission, Evaluation and Defense
Each Ph.D. student is expected to write a thesis report on the Ph.D. work. The thesis
has to be submitted by the student for evaluation. Guidelines for Ph.D. thesis
evaluation are given separately.
(11) Award of degree
a. Upon acceptance of the revised thesis by the PG committee, the Chairman, Senate may
recommend the award of the Ph.D. degree to the student. While pending the actual
award of the degree in a regular convocation of the Institute, the Chairman, Senate
may also authorize the Registrar to issue a provisional certificate to a student who
completes the requirements for graduation.
The date on the degree shall be as follows:
 May 21 for the students who finish their requirements during the winter semester
(e.g. 8th semester of B.Tech.)
26
 Aug 21 for those who finish the requirements during summer term.
 Dec 21 for those who finish the requirement during the Monsoon semester
16. Prizes and Medals/Awards at Graduation
a. The academic Senate of the institute can set up awards, prizes, medals etc. to be given to
deserving students at graduation time.
b. Under exceptional circumstances, where gross violation of the conditions of the
awards/recognition or academic misconduct is detected at a later stage, the Senate may
recommend to the Board of Governors to withdraw the award and recognition
17. Disciplinary Action Framework
IIIT-Delhi maintains global academic standards in its own education system. Therefore, it
does not tolerate any form of indiscipline/ academic dishonesty. Action will be taken
against students found engaging in acts of indiscipline/ academic dishonesty by
Disciplinary Action Committee (DAC) constituted by the Director. The disciplinary
action may result in semester/year/two year drop or even expulsion from the Institute.
Separate rules and regulations have been formulated to handle the cases of violations.
18. Migration from B.Tech. to Dual Degree Program
A B.Tech. student can opt to migrate to dual degree program of the institute anytime
before the last date of Add/Drop of his/her 7th semester of the B.Tech. program.
Eligibility criteria for this and regulations for the dual degree program are given
separately.
19. Power to Modify
Notwithstanding all that has been stated above, the Senate has the right to modify any of
the above regulations from time to time.

Annexure I
Guidelines for change of Supervisor(Refer para 15(5),c-above)
Guiding Ph.D. students by a supervisor is one of the longest and strongest associations between a
student and faculty. It is based on mutual trust and respect, in which a student expects the
supervisor to protect his/her interests, and supervisor expects high quality research work. While
change of supervisor at early stages is not uncommon and there is a standard process for it,
sometimes, due to various reasons, the student-supervisor relationship is formally terminated
even at a late stage. This note aims to provide some guidelines if the change of supervisor
happens at a late stage when some research has been already done. The guidelines are based on:

It will be assumed that all research work done by the student and supervisor before the
termination of student-supervisor relationship was being done towards the Ph.D. thesis of the
student, unless both agree for some work that it was done for some other purposes and was not
meant to be included in the thesis.

Rights of supervisor and student regarding authorship and publications, and rights of
supervisor for using the past-works (e.g. for building upon it, using as project deliverables,
having another student work on it, etc) and of student for using the past-works (e.g. towards
his/her Ph.D. degree) should be protected.
Guidelines
A. Change of supervisor at a late stage of the student‟s Ph.D. should be avoided and all
attempts should be made to take the relationship to its logical conclusion - namely
submission of the thesis. The possibility of having the past supervisor continue as a co-
supervisor should also be explored. Change of supervisor at a late stage should happen
only as the last resort.
B. If the student continues in the Institute with some other supervisor and does not want to
use previous work (e.g., start on a new problem), then this is like the normal change of
supervisor, which can follow existing process.
C. If the student continues in the Institute with some other supervisor and wishes to use
some of the past works in his/her thesis, the following steps will be taken:
a. A meeting shall be called between the previous supervisor, new supervisor and
the student. They may invite any other faculty member as well. If they can reach
an agreement on use of previous work and role of previous supervisor (including,
for example, him/her remaining as a co-supervisor without being an examiner for
the thesis), that agreement will be recorded and followed.
b. If the meeting does not result in any agreement, then in the final thesis certificate,
contribution of the previous supervisor will be explicitly recorded (e.g., it may be
stated that Prof. X was supervisor from date1 to date2, and Prof. Y from date2). If
the previous work included in the thesis is substantial, the previous supervisor can
31
also ask to be a co-supervisor, without any administrative rights and without
being an examiner for the PhD thesis.
D. If the student leaves the Institute, and wishes to use past work in his/her thesis and
continue with some supervisor in another university/institute, he/she may seek permission
through the new university/institute for use of these works. Institute will take a view
based on IP protection and approval of the previous supervisor.
E. If the supervisor leaves the Institute, then possibility of him/her continuing as a
supervisor or co-supervisor should be explored. If such an arrangement is not possible or
fails for any reason, the student can use the previous work in the thesis. In this case, it
will be explicitly recorded in the final thesis certificate that the outgoing faculty member
was the supervisor from Date1 to Date2.
F. Other cases not covered by the above, or any exceptions to the above, or any disputes in
implementing these guidelines, will be brought to the PGC, which will advise the Senate,
which will take the final view.

5. Financial Assistance
(1) Teaching and Research Assistantship
a. Financial assistantship is available for some PhD / MTech students in the form of
Teaching Assistantship or Research Assistantship.
(i) Teaching assistantship. The students under this plan are expected to help the
instructors in various courses for the smooth running of the course.
(ii) Research assistantship. The students under this plan are expected to help the
faculty members in various research projects. They may be assigned limited
academic duties.
b. A student whose stipend is coming from a sponsored project or an external fellowship
obtained through individual application (like TCS, IBM, Microsoft, Google etc.), will
be considered RAs while they are getting support from these grants/fellowships. All
other students will be considered TAs.
c. Only full-time regular students are eligible for assistantships and scholarships. A PhD
student is not eligible for teaching assistantship or scholarship after five years.
d. The teaching/research assistantship for PhD students comprises sustenance stipend
(25% of total), scholarship (25%), and remuneration for academic work (50%).
e. There may a performance linked incentive each year, the quantum of which will be
decided by PG Committee.
f. Assistantship for MTech students will be viewed as remuneration for the academic
work (teaching/research) being performed for the institute.
g. Teaching Assistantship for M.Tech. and Ph.D. students will be a ‘0' credit course which
will show up in Transcript. S or X grade will be allotted for the TA work.
(2) Other Financial Assistance
a. Certain other kinds of financial assistantship such as scholarships or Fellowships might
also be available from sources other than the Institute.
6
(3) Withdrawal and reduction of financial assistantship
a. For PhD students, the financial support continuation shall be contingent upon the
performance in academics and the assigned academic/administrative duties and will be
reviewed every semester. The scholarship part of the Assistantship may be terminated
if the student's academic performance is not as per standards (defined later). The
remuneration part may be terminated or reduced if the student's performance in his/her
assigned duties is not satisfactory. The sustenance part may not be terminated or
reduced as long as the student remains a full time student of the Institute. The
reduction/termination, if any, shall be decided by the PG committee each year, based
on the performance of the student.
b. For MTech students, the financial support continuation shall be based on academic
performance
and
performance
in
assigned
duties
(teaching/research).
Continuation/reduction/termination of financial support will be decided by the PGC
every semester.
6. Change from One Program to Another
(1) A student can change his/her registration from one program to another. All such requests
shall be made by the student along with the supporting documents. After evaluation of the
requests, the PG committee may approve the change. The credits for the courses and thesis
shall be transferred to the new program. The change shall not be permitted if the academic
performance in the old program is not good enough for continuation in the new program.
After the changes, the rules for the new program shall be applicable.
(2) A PhD student can change his/her program to MTech. If this change is done by a student,
he/she will be treated as being in the MTech program from the start of his/her program,
and will have to refund the difference in fees and stipend between the PhD and MTech
programs, if any.
(3) If a PhD student fails his or her first two reviews, then the PGC may propose either that he
or she leaves the institute; or enroll in the MTech program. If the latter, then usually full
MTech fees would be payable by the student, along with any differences in stipends. In
some cases, the stipend difference may be reduced, waived or deferred on case by case
basis.
A warning letter will be issued by the Academic Section to students when they fail the first
review which should also explain the above.
7
(4) In special cases when a PhD thesis is not found suitable for PhD, the candidate can convert
to MTech and resubmit the thesis with suitable enhancements for MTech (and ensure that
other requirements are met). In such a case, repaying of difference in stipends and fees may
be waived.
(5) An MTech student can change his/her program, if permitted, to PhD and continue to do the
course/research work to enable him/her to meet the requirements of the PhD degree. The
student will be eligible for PhD stipends only from the time he/she is enrolled as PhD
student. Such a student, for PhD credit requirement, may be treated as if he/she had joined
the PhD program from the start of the PG program. The student may be granted an MTech
also, provided he/she fulfils requirements for the same. Such a student may also be
refunded his/her MTech tuition fee, if he/she successfully completes the PhD program.
7. PhD Student getting an MTech
A student admitted in the PhD program after a BTech can get an MTech "on the way" provided
he/she completes the requirements for the same. For this:
 Courses done for PhD can count towards the MTech degree.
 Work done in the Scholarly Paper or MTech thesis cannot be included in the PhD thesis.
 A PhD student can apply for an MTech degree only after completing the Comprehensive
and after spending at least five semesters in the Institute.
 If a PhD student who gets an MTech and leaves the Institute without completing his/her
PhD, he/she will be considered as having changed his program from PhD to MTech (and
will have to refund the difference between stipends and fees as per rules.)
8. Registration
(1) General
a. All Postgraduate students, full time as well as part time, are required to register each
regular semester, unless they are on approved leave of absence. If a student is working
outside the Institute (e.g. working with an external co-supervisor) must register through
electronic means.
b. Registration process has two parts: Academic, and administrative and both must be
completed in order to complete the registration process. Academic registration includes
filling the registration form and specifying the courses that the student plans to do in
the semester and getting it approved. Administrative part includes paying all dues to
the Institute. A student who is working outside the Institute may get this completed
through a friend/adviser/etc,
8
c. A student shall normally register for courses if their course requirement conditions are
not fulfilled. A student may register for the courses and thesis simultaneously in a
semester. Thesis/Scholarly Paper registration will be in multiple "courses" of 4 credits
each (i.e. for 8 credits, a student will have to register for two thesis courses, each of 4
credits) and S/X grades will be assigned to each of these.
(2) Pre-Registration of Courses
Pre-registration is necessary part of the academic registration for non-first semester
students. In case a student fails to do pre-registration of courses, a penalty may be imposed
if the student does not register his/her preference within the stipulated period.
(3) Late Registration
a. Late registration is permitted as per academic calendar on the payment of late
registration fee. The late fee may be waived if the delay is due to an academic activity
undertaken with prior permission. The number of days missed due to late arrival shall
be treated as leave of absence. A fee for late academic registration may be imposed.
(4) Adding or Dropping of Courses
a. A student can change the courses that he/she does in a semester by adding and dropping
courses till the last date for add/drop as specified in the academic calendar. In addition,
a student can drop, with permission from the PG Committee, some courses even beyond
the last date for add/drop. The last date for the latter shall also be mentioned in the
academic calendar.
(5) Cancellation of registration
a. A student is solely responsible to ensure that all conditions for proper registration are
satisfied, and there are no timetable clashes. The registration may be cancelled by
DOAA for a course if any irregularity is found at a later stage. A student's registration
for the semester may be cancelled as part of disciplinary action. Leave beyond
permissible limits may also result in cancellation of registration for a semester.
(6) Summer term registration
Registration in the summer term is optional. But if a PG student is doing some academic
work, he/she is required to register. A PG student on financial plan of the Institute is
expected to remain in the Institute and work during the summer term even if he/she is
not registered, though he/she may take vacation as per rules. A student may register for
up to 8 credits of which up to 4 credits may be for thesis work/IS.
9
(7) Registration of an Audit Course
A PG/Ph.D. student can be allowed to take a course as Audit on the condition that it will count
in the maximum course load for a semester but not in the calculation of CGPA. Further, the
faculty teaching the course will specify the requirements including attendance and a minimum
passing grade right in the beginning. The final grade for Audit course will, however, be ‘S" or
‘X'.
9. Leave Rules
The students may be granted leave of absence on application to the PG committee. The
following leaves are applicable:
(1) Vacation and casual leave
a. A post graduate student on financial assistance plan from the Institute may be allowed
vacation leave during any period of Institute's vacation or during the mid-semester
recess up to a maximum of 15 days per semester (six months), subject to a maximum
of 30 days at a time. Leave not availed in one semester may be carried over to the next
semester.
b. In addition, a student irrespective of the financial assistance may be allowed to go on casual
leave for up to 8 working days in a calendar year , with permission.
(2) On-Duty leave

a. A PG student who is on financial assistance may be granted leave during the summer
vacation period for undertaking internships, projects etc. This will be "leave without
pay" and during this period, the student will not get the assistantship/scholarship.
Decision on such leave requests will be made by the PG committee, which may not
grant this leave if it views that granting of the leave can hinder the completion of the
PG program of the student. All students taking such leave, must report for registration
the next semester, even if they do not have any course requirement next semester. Any
relaxation of this guideline will be decided by the PG committee, and will be granted
only on academic grounds (e.g. a student is attending a conference).
(4) Semester leave
a. Semester leave may be granted to students by the PG committee upon
recommendations of the supervisor on various accounts, including medical, for up to a

11. Teaching and Evaluation
(1) Teaching
a. As specified in the Regulations for BTech Program
(2) Continuous evaluation
a. As specified in the Regulations for BTech Program
12
(3) Grading scheme
a. One of the letter grades given in the following table shall be awarded to a
student reflecting his/her overall performance in a course. Each letter grade
carries certain points as given in the table, and these points are used in the
computation of the SGPA/CGPA as explained later.
Letter Grade
Grade Points Remarks
A+ (Outstanding)
10
Letter grades A+ to F and I are given only in the regular
courses.
This grading scheme is effectively A to F; A+ is only to
recognize excellent performers in a course - it has same
points as A.
A (Very Good)
10
A(-)
9
B (Good)
8
B(-)
7
C (Satisfactory)
6
C(-)
5
D (Marginal)
4
F (Fail)
2
F Grade is not counted in the calculation of CGPA,
however, it is counted in the calculation of SGPA.
I (Incomplete)
Nil
Incomplete (I grade) must be converted to one of the
letter grades (A to F) as per the academic calendar
W(Withdrawn)
Nil
"W" grade shall be printed in the transcript of the
students who do ‘Late Drop'
S (Satisfactory)
Nil
S and X are grades for only certain kinds of courses like
Audit course. They are not incorporated in SGPA/CGPA
calculation.
X (Unsatisfactory)
Nil
a. In the academic courses, the final grades awarded are A to F (A+ is a grade with same
points as A, and is there to honor excellence).
b. An I (Incomplete) grade may be awarded in cases when all the requirements for a
course are not met by the student at the time of submission of grades, and essentially
reflects an "incomplete" status in the course. This grade must be converted to a regular
letter grade (A to F) within the two weeks from the last date of the submission of the
grades as stipulated in the academic calendar. Only for the project works and
independent study courses, an additional two weeks will be admissible for the change
of I grade. All unconverted I grades get automatically converted to F after this period.
c. All courses in which a student obtains an F grade must be repeated or replaced by
another equivalent course.
d. Thesis/Scholarly Paper registration will be in multiple "courses" of 4 credits each ( i.e.
for 8 credits, a student will have to register for two thesis courses, each of 4 credits)
and S/X grades will be assigned to each of these. Further, student's advisor(s) also
has(have) to submit a report for student's progress to PGC.
13
(4) Performance Indicators - SGPA and CGPA
a. The semester performance is indicated by a Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)
which is a weighted sum of all the points earned in the courses done in a semester. The
SGPA is given for each semester and is computed using the following formula.
SGPA = (u1.w1 + u2.w2 + … + un.wn) / (u1 + u2 + … + un),
whereui is the number of units for the course i and wi is the points earned through the
letter grade in that course.
b. While doing the computation of SGPA, the course/thesis units with grades S and X are
ignored.
c. The overall performance is indicated by a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)
which is computed in the same manner as the computation of SGPA but for all the
courses done in the program. While the F and X grades shall show on the grade sheet,
the original grade of a course repeated/replaced is ignored in the computation of
SGPA/CGPA.
d. ‘F' grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, however, it is counted in the
calculation of SGPA.
12. Minimum Academic Performance Requirements
(1) M Tech program
a. The minimum graduating CGPA is 6.5.
b. The minimum CGPA for continuing in the program is 6.0. If the CGPA falls below
this, the student may be placed under warning first, and if the performance does not
improve, may be asked to leave the program.
(2) PhD program
a. The minimum graduating CGPA is 7.5.
b. The minimum continuing CGPA is 7.0. If the CGPA falls below this, he/she may be asked to
shift to MTech program or leave.
c. If the SGPA in the first semester falls below 7, the student concerned will be issued a
warningby Academic Section.
14
13. Students under Warning
(1) A student who is under warning will normally not be entitled for two components of his
stipend - scholarship and assistantship. He/she will get only the sustenance portion. The
student will also not be allowed to be on any elected/nominated committee representing
students of the Institute, and if he is on any committee he/she shall resign.
14. Requirements for the MTech Degree
(1) Per Semester Load Requirements
A normal full time load is 12 credits to 20 credits. Students who are on assistantship can be
given a relaxation of 4 credits. A student may be permitted an overload of at most 4 credits in
a semester, with permission from the PG committee. The students who have completed the
stipulated course requirements shall register for thesis or scholarly paperin multiple "courses"
of 4 credits each ( i.e. for 8 credits, a student will have to register for two thesis courses, each
of 4 credits) and S/X grades will be assigned to each of these. No overload shall be permitted
in the thesis unit registration. Part time students may register for any number of credits lesser
than the normal full-time load.
(2) Course Work Requirements
a. A student may do an MTech with thesis or with scholarly paper. In with-thesis option,
an MTech student must complete a minimum of 32 credits of course work. In the
Scholarly Paper option, the student must complete 40 or 44 credits (depending on the
credits of the Scholarly Paper). The supervisor or the PGC may advise the students with
insufficient background to do additional course units.In addition, students may be
required to do some "refresher" modules for strengthening their background. These
modules will be reflected in the transcript.
For the students admitted in academic year 2016-17, except for summer refresher
course, the grade obtained in Object Oriented Programming and Research Methods will
be counted towards CGPA calculation without counting its credits towards degree
requirements for M.Tech. This requirement will be waived for those students whose
background does not have the deficiency. However, from academic year 2017-18 the
above decision will be implemented for all refresher courses.
b. An MTech student may be permitted to replace up to two courses done by him/her and
in which s/he has obtained passing, but not good (e.g. C or lower), grade. The
replacement will be permitted as and when the request is made by the concerned student
15
after publication of the result provided it does not result in underload. In this case, the
earlier course will be listed in the transcript as having been taken on "Audit". An
MTech student may also be allowed to do extra courses. All such permissions shall be
granted by the PG committee upon requests from the students
c. Online Courses
IIIT-Delhi has evolved a system for allowing students to take online courses. Students
can take advantage of the increasing amount of such courses made available by
reputed universities across the world to complement the courses offered in the
institute.
M.Tech. students doing Online course under IP/IS will be awarded regular grade (A
to F) by the concerned faculty supervisor
(3) Thesis/Scholarly Paper credit and Total Credit requirements
a. For MTech with-thesis, a student has to complete a minimum of 16 credits of thesis.
For MTechwith scholarly paper instead of a thesis, he/she has to complete 4 or 8

with scholarly paper ).
b. For the purpose of grading in the thesis/scholarly paper credits registered, the progress
in the thesis/scholarly paper work shall be assessed by the thesis supervisor(s). For each
semester, one S (if the performance is satisfactory) or one X (if the performance is not
satisfactory) grade shall be awarded by the thesis supervisor(s) to each of the registered
thesis courses of 4 credit each.
(4) Thesis Option: Supervisor,Evaluation, and Defense
a. The MTechthesis shall be done under the guidance of thesis supervisor(s), who
shall be faculty member(s) of the Institute. A thesis may also have co-supervisors,
who may be Adjunct Faculty of the Institute, or external co-supervisors approved
by the PG Committee.
b. An M.Tech. thesis shall be evaluated by an evaluation committee which shall consist of
the supervisor(s), including co-supervisors, and two other non-supervisor examiners. For a
thesis, it is desirable to have one of the examiners from outside the Institute. The committee
must be approved by the PG Committee.
16
c. TheMTech thesis must be defended by the student in front of the thesis evaluation
committee. The defense should be held no earlier than one-week after the thesis has
been submitted (exceptions may be granted by PG Committee Chair). The thesis
evaluation committee shall make its recommendation to the PGC.
d. For Scholarly paper (including industrial project ) the evaluation committee
consists of only the Supervisor (s).
e. For Capstone project the evaluation committee consists of Supervisors which include
supervisor from industry/research lab. The grades for members in a team will be decided
by the supervisors of the project, based on their assessment of the work done by the
members, and the extent to which they have been able to meet the deliverables
(5) Scholarly Paper Option: Supervisor and Evaluation
a. A student doing MTech with Scholarly Paper has multiple options for completing the
scholarly paper requirement: a Regular Scholarly Paper, Industrial Project, and a
Capstone Project.
b. Regular Scholarly Paper: The regular scholarly paper shall be done under the guidance
of a supervisor, who shall be a faculty member of the Institute. A scholarly paper may
also have co-supervisors, who may be Adjunct Faculty of the Institute, or external co-
supervisors approved by the PG Committee.For this scholarly paper, no defense is required.
It will be evaluated and signed by the supervisor(s) and the result along with copy of Scholarly
paper communicated to the Academic Administration.
c. Industrial Project: Scholarly paper can alsobe done by doing an industrial project of
6 months or more inapproved Industry/research lab./academic labs. The student doing the
Industrial Project will have to submit a report at the end of the project, duly approved by the
supervisor/mentor/manager in the company/research lab.
d. Capstone Project: Scholarly paper can also be done through a capstone project. The projects
are usually defined by one or more faculty members who will act as supervisors, but can include
supervisors from industry or other academic institutions. Students can undertake to do a project
singly or in a team. The deliverables of the project will be clearly specified by the supervisors,
as will the grading scheme to be adopted in meeting these deliverables. The grades for the
students in the team will be decided by the supervisors of the project, based on their assessment
of the work done/deliverables, and the project report. The gradesalong with a copy of project
report will be communicated to the Academic Administration.
17
(6) Award of degree
Upon a satisfactory report from the Dean, Academic Affairs, the Academic Senate may
recommend the award of the MTech degree to the student. While pending the actual award of the
degree in a regular convocation of the Institute, the Dean of Academic Affairs may authorize the
Registrar to issue a provisional certificate to a student who completes the requirements for
graduation.
15. Requirements for the PhD Degree
(1) General
A student shall be considered for the award of PhD degree by the academic Senate only
upon the completion of the requirements mentioned here. Per semester load requirements
of PhD students is same as for MTech students. However, PhD students who are on
assistantship may be given a relaxation of up to 8 units in the normal full time load.
(2) Course Work Requirement
a. The requirement of the course work for a PhD student is aimed at providing the basic
academic preparation to carry out the research, and have sufficient breadth in the area.
The minimum course requirement for a PhD student is normally 32 units for students
whose highest degree is a BTech (or equivalent), and 16for those who have an MTech
(or equivalent). After the course work, the student is expected to have sufficient breadth
in at least three of the main sub-areas of Computer Science. The PG committee may
ask the students with insufficient background to do additional courses (in addition to
32/16 units).
Further, the following is the upper limit for Independent Study (IS)/ Independent
project (IP) within the course credit requirement for Ph.D. degree:
i) B.Tech. Degree holders (for Ph.D.in CSE/ECE/CB/Maths) - 1 IS and 1 IP (4 credits each)
ii) M.Tech. Degree holders (for Ph.D.in CSE/ECE/CB/Maths) - 1 IS (4 credits)
iii) M.Sc. Degree holders (for Ph.D.in Maths) - 1 IS (4 credits)
b. In special cases, for students with advance standing by virtue of their academic
preparedness and/or by virtue of their professional work experience, some of the course
requirements may be waived. All such waivers shall be decided upon by the PG
Committee and reported to the Senate.
c. A PhD student may be permitted to replace up to two courses done by him/her and in
which he/she has obtained passing, but not good, grade. The replacement will be
permitted as and when the request is made by the concerned student after publication
18
of result provided it does not result in underload. In this case, the earlier course will be
listed in the transcript as having been taken on "Audit". He/She may also be permitted
to do extra courses to improve the CGPA. All such permissions shall be granted by the
PG committee upon requests from the students.
d. RM5xx Research Methods a two credit course will be compulsory for all new PhD students
(3) Transfer of Credits for Courses done Outside
a. Students may be permitted to do academic work and courses in places of repute outside
IIIT-Delhi. Based on their performance/quantum of work done and the content of the
course, the PG committee may consider them equivalent to some course credits, and
waive credit requirements for similar courses/projects within IIIT-Delhi. Institutions
with which IIIT-Delhi has arrangements/MOU/student exchange programs, transfer of
credits may also be permitted. Any such waivers/transfer is permitted only if the
courses being considered have not been counted for any other degree/diploma
requirement.
(4) Thesis credit requirements
a. All PhD students irrespective of their entry category are expected to successfully
complete a minimum of 56 units by thesis. In truly exceptional cases where the PhD
candidate is ready with a thesis before he/she has accumulated these credits, the PG
committee can consider waiving off some of these units. For the purpose of grading in
the thesis units registered, the progress in the thesis work shall be assessed by the thesis
supervisor(s). For each semester, one S (if the performance is satisfactory) or one X (if
the performance is not satisfactory) grade shall be awarded by the thesis supervisor(s).
The thesis grades shall be submitted by the thesis supervisor(s) at the end of the
semester.
Ph.D. students on completion of 5 years of registration will continue to do online
registration in the ERP and will present their progress of research work before the
monitoring committee till they submit the final thesis for evaluation.
(5) Thesis Supervisor and External Co-supervisor
a. The thesis work shall be done under the guidance of the PhD supervisor, who shall be
a faculty member of the Institute. An adjunct faculty can also be a supervisor, with
permission of the PGC. There may be multiple supervisors. Normally, a student is
expected to decide the supervisor(s) by the start of the second semester but can defer it
till the end of second semester .This will be done by informing the PG Committee
through a form/letter, which shall be signed by the supervisor(s). A student can change
19
the supervisor later - for this a formal request will have to be submitted to PG
Committee and has to be signed by the old as well as the new supervisors.
b. A student may also have external co-supervisors for the thesis. Such external co-
supervisor shall be approved by the PG Committee upon a request by the student, duly
approved and forwarded by the supervisor(s). The request must be accompanied by the
CV/Bio or sufficient information about the proposed external co-supervisor which will
allow the PGC to evaluate the suitability. Normally, the external co-supervisor should
be finalized before the comprehensive and the PGC should be informed by the adviser
and the student about the same.
c. Change of Supervisor at a late stage:If the change of supervisor happens at a late stage
when some research has been already done, the request should be considered as per guidelines
for change of supervisor at a late stage approved by the Senate (32.19).
(6) Monitoring Committee and Yearly Review / Yearly Seminar
a. The PG Committee shall form a monitoring committee for each candidate, whose task
will be to independently monitor and report on the progress of the candidate. The
committee should generally be formed before the end of the candidate's second
semester in the program and should consist of at least three faculty members/experts.
b. The monitoring committee shall submit its evaluation about the progress of the candidate,
at least once a year. If the monitoring committee feels that the candidate is not making
sufficient progress, it may recommend suitable actions to be taken, including
recommending that the student leave the PhD program or migrate to MTech, as given in
6(3). This review may be done by requiring the PhD students to make presentations about
their progress, or through some other method.
(7) Comprehensive
The aim of the comprehensive examination is to check the understanding of the PhD
student about his/her area of research. (Though a comprehensive traditionally was
meant to check that the student has sufficient breadth, the Institute feels that this type
of breadth requirement should be fulfilled through courses, and the comprehensive
should be used to test the "comprehension" of the candidate about his/her main area of
research.) For the comprehensive, the student shall present a complete literature survey
(much on the lines of papers in ACM Surveys), research proposal and research plan on
his/her area of work. The survey report will be submitted to the committee formed for
the comprehensive exam by the PG Committee. The student will present a seminar on
the above. The seminar should be open for all to attend. After the seminar, the
committee may examine the student further and will submit its report regarding the
20
outcome of the comprehensive to the PG Committee. If the student fails the
examination, he/she is allowed an additional half a semester ( i.e. 3 months) to retry.
A student is expected to complete his/her comprehensive examination as per the
followingtimeline:
Sl. Category of Ph.D.studentsTime limit for completion
of Comprehensive
1. PhD students admitted directly from a BTech 5 semesters
2. PhD students after completing MTech 3 semesters
3. PhD students migrating from MTech 3 semesters from the date
of joining PhD
(8) Regular Seminars / Yearly Review
This requirement for regular seminar or a yearly review is moved to item (6).
(9) Teaching Requirements
a. One of the potential career options for the research students is academics. The PhD
program at IIIT-Delhi aims to develop suitable teaching skills among the research
students through teaching requirements. Towards this, it requires all students on
financial assistantship plan of the Institute are required to take part in the teaching
activities.
b. All PhD students must be TA for at least two semesters to satisfy the teaching
requirements for a PhD degree. Students on research assistantship will also be required
to complete this requirement, though they may be assigned lighter load each semester.
The feedback received from the course students on the TA work will be part of the PhD
student record, and will be an input in evaluation.
c. Students will be assigned their TA duties towards the end of a regular semester for
courses in the next semester. During the break, they should prepare themselves for the
course, and with help from the instructor, design the assignments, develop the solutions
and grading of the assignments. They will also be involved in the grading of the exam
papers and developing the solutions to the exam papers. Senior students are also
encouraged to be a tutor as well as take part in the class room teaching, along with the
corresponding instructors. Such arrangements are to be worked out between the
instructor in-charge of the course and the student. It is expected that the load of TA
21
work in a semester will be similar to that of a course, that is, approximately 10 hours
per week.
d. The teaching requirement may be waived for part-time and/or sponsored candidates (as
their professional goals are likely to be already defined.)
(10) Thesis submission, Evaluation and Defense
Each PhD student is expected to write a thesis report on the PhD work. The thesis has
to be submitted by the student for evaluation. Guidelines for Ph.D. thesis evaluation
are given separately.
(11) Award of degree
a. Upon acceptance of the revised thesis by the PG committee, the Chairman, Senate may
recommend the award of the PhD degree to the student. While pending the actual
award of the degree in a regular convocation of the Institute,the Chairman, Senate
may also authorize the Registrar to issue a provisional certificate to a student who
completes the requirements for graduation.
(1)
The date on the degree shall be as follows:
 May 21 for the students who finish their requirements during the winter semester
(e.g. 8th semester of BTech)
 Aug 21 for those who finish the requirements during summer term.
 Dec 21 for those who finish the requirement during the Monsoon semester
16. Prizes and Medals/Awards at Graduation
a. The academic Senate of the institute can set up awards, prizes, medals etc. to be given to
deserving students at graduation time.
b. Under exceptional circumstances, where gross violation of the conditions of the
awards/recognition or academic misconduct is detected at a later stage, the Senate may
recommend to the Board of Governors to withdraw the award and recognition
22
17. Disciplinary Action Framework
IIIT-Delhi maintains global academic standards in its own education system. Therefore, it
does not tolerate any form of indiscipline/ academic dishonesty. Action will be taken
against students found engaging in acts of indiscipline/ academic dishonesty by
Disciplinary Action Committee (DAC) constituted by the Director. The disciplinary
action may result in semester/year/two year drop or even expulsion from the Institute.
Separate rules and regulations have been formulated to handle the cases of violations.
18. Migration from BTech to Dual Degree Program
A B.Tech student can opt to migrate to dual degree program of the institute anytime before
the last date of Add/Drop of his/her 7th semester of the BTech program. Eligibility criteria
for this and regulations for the dual degree program are given separately.
19. Special Discipline-Specific Requirements for PhD
(1) Special Requirements for CSE
None
(2) Special Requirements for ECE
a) The first yearly review will be done through a viva-voce, in a manner as specified and notified
by the PhD coordinator for ECE.
b) Students joining the PhD program with MTech degree will need to do at least 20 credits of course
work.
(3) Special Requirement for CB
None
(4) Special requirements for Mathematics
a) The minimum course requirement for a PhD student is 24 units for a student whose highest
degree is MSc (Mathematics), and 16 units for those who have an MPhil (Mathematics).
b) For the comprehensive examination, the student shall present a complete literature survey
(much on the lines of papers in EMS Surveys in Mathematical Sciences/Expositions
Mathematicae), research proposal and research plan on his/her area of work.
c) Timeline for completion of comprehensive examination for a candidate with M.Sc. (Mathematics)
and M.Phil(Mathematics) the timeline will be 4 and 3 semesters respectively.

Regulations for the B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering
(CSE) Program
1.
Preamble
IIIT-Delhi aims to encourage research and innovation in Information Technology (IT) and allied
areas. The objective of the B.Tech. program in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is to
prepare students to undertake careers involving innovation and problem solving using
computational techniques and technologies, or to undertake advanced studies for research
careers, or to take up Entrepreneurship.
In order to give due importance to applied as well as theoretical aspects of computing, the
curriculum for the B.Tech. (CSE) program covers most of the foundational aspects of computing
sciences, and also develops in students the engineering skills for problem solving using
computing sciences.
Most engineering programs start with general courses in Sciences, and then migrate to
specialized courses for the disciplines. While these courses are indeed foundational for many
engineering disciplines, they can be treated as application domains (as is evidenced from the fact
that most Sciences and Engineering disciplines heavily use computing now). Hence, the B.Tech.
(CSE) program at IIIT-Delhi starts with computing oriented courses first, and allows the
possibility of doing Science courses later. Besides being better suited for a CSE program, it also
enables the possibility of students seeing newer applications and possibilities of using computing
in these subjects.
With this approach, the B.Tech. (CSE) program can be divided broadly in two halves. The first
half focuses on building the foundations, and is highly structured. The second part is for
developing the skills and knowledge of the students in various topics - computing and
application domains. This part also provides limited specializations, and different students may
follow different paths and take different set of courses in it. Overall objectives of the B.Tech.
(CSE) program are to help develop the following attributes in students:
1. Understanding of theoretical foundations and limits of computing
2. Understanding of computing at different levels of abstraction including circuits and
computer architecture, operating systems, algorithms, and applications.
3. Ability to adapt established models, techniques, algorithms, data structures, etc., for
efficiently solving new problems
4. Ability to design, implement, and evaluate computer based system or application to meet
the desired needs using modern tools and methodologies
5. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal
6. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
2
7. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audience
8. Ability to self-learn and engage in life-long learning
9. Understanding and ability to use advanced techniques and tools in different areas of
computing
10. Ability to undertake small research tasks and projects
11. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture (if
desired)
12. An understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (CSE) program - the general
regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document. These regulations are in
addition to the regulations of the B.Tech. program.

Program Structure
1. The Foundation program provides the basic knowledge about Computer Science (CS)
through a set of core courses, which are compulsory for all students. This program consists of
four major streams: software, hardware, theory, and systems. Besides these, there are courses
in Maths, communication skills, environment studies also as part of the core program.
2. The set of core courses are shown in the table below (courses mentioned in [ ] are
electives and actual courses for these slots are as defined from semester to semester.)

4. The semester mentioned for the core courses is indicative and suggested, and they can be
done later/earlier also. However, the pre-requisite requirements must be kept in mind by a
student, if he/she wishes to do a core course in some other semester.
5. In the Engineering Science/Math course slots in second year, students can take only from
the list of courses specified for those slots.
3. The Advanced Part and Streams
1. The rest of the program consists mostly of elective courses. An elective course is one
which is not compulsory, and a student may have choices from which to select the courses
he/she wants to do.
2. Some of the electives may be organized as streams, where a stream is a sequence of
courses in an area providing a limited specialization in that area.
3. Besides electives and streams for specialized areas, streams and electives from domain
areas (e.g. health, life sciences, finance, economics, E-Governance, sciences, etc.) may also
be offered.
4. The number and nature of streams and electives will evolve and may change with time,
providing the ability to accommodate the evolving nature of computing and its applications
in the program. Some of the current streams are in these areas:
o Image Processing and Machine Intelligence
o Data Analytics
o Mobile Computing
o Security and Privacy
o Hardware
o Theory
5
o Finance
o Environment
o Economics
o Sciences (Physics, Biology)
Note: Streams in the UG programs will not be shown on the transcript. However, the
students may be guided about the courses belonging to a certain area during the
course counseling session conducted at the beginning of the semester. Guidance on
streams should also be put on the website for information of the students.
5. There will also be a set of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) courses offered.
6. List of courses, and further information about the courses is available on the website:
https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/courses

is not compulsory, and a student may have choices from which to select the courses he/she
wants to do.
2. Some of the electives may be organized as streams, where a stream is a sequence of courses
in an area providing a limited specialization in that area.
3. Besides electives and streams for specialized areas, streams and electives from domain
areas (e.g. health, life sciences, finance, economics, E-Governance, sciences, etc.) may also be
offered.
4. The number and nature of streams and electives will evolve and may change with time,
providing the ability to accommodate the evolving nature of computing and its applications in
the program. Some of the current streams are in these areas:
o Image Processing and Machine Intelligence
o Data Analytics
o Mobile Computing
o Security and Privacy
o Hardware
o Theory
5
o Finance
o Environment
o Economics
o Sciences (Physics, Biology)
Note: Streams in the UG programs will not be shown on the transcript. However, the
students may be guided about the courses belonging to a certain area during the
course counseling session conducted at the beginning of the semester. Guidance on
streams should also be put on the website for information of the students.
5. There will also be a set of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) courses offered.
6. List of courses, and further information about the courses is available on the website:

Regulations for the B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering
(CSE) Program
1.
Preamble
IIIT-Delhi aims to encourage research and innovation in Information Technology (IT) and allied
areas. The objective of the B.Tech. program in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is to
prepare students to undertake careers involving innovation and problem solving using
computational techniques and technologies, or to undertake advanced studies for research
careers, or to take up Entrepreneurship.
In order to give due importance to applied as well as theoretical aspects of computing, the
curriculum for the B.Tech. (CSE) program covers most of the foundational aspects of computing
sciences, and also develops in students the engineering skills for problem solving using
computing sciences.
Most engineering programs start with general courses in Sciences, and then migrate to
specialized courses for the disciplines. While these courses are indeed foundational for many
engineering disciplines, they can be treated as application domains (as is evidenced from the fact
that most Sciences and Engineering disciplines heavily use computing now). Hence, the B.Tech.
(CSE) program at IIIT-Delhi starts with computing oriented courses first, and allows the
possibility of doing Science courses later. Besides being better suited for a CSE program, it also
enables the possibility of students seeing newer applications and possibilities of using computing
in these subjects.
With this approach, the B.Tech. (CSE) program can be divided broadly in two halves. The first
half focuses on building the foundations, and is highly structured. The second part is for
developing the skills and knowledge of the students in various topics - computing and
application domains. This part also provides limited specializations, and different students may
follow different paths and take different set of courses in it. Overall objectives of the B.Tech.
(CSE) program are to help develop the following attributes in students:
1. Understanding of theoretical foundations and limits of computing
2. Understanding of computing at different levels of abstraction including circuits and
computer architecture, operating systems, algorithms, and applications.
3. Ability to adapt established models, techniques, algorithms, data structures, etc., for
efficiently solving new problems
4. Ability to design, implement, and evaluate computer based system or application to meet
the desired needs using modern tools and methodologies
5. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal
6. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
2
7. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audience
8. Ability to self-learn and engage in life-long learning
9. Understanding and ability to use advanced techniques and tools in different areas of
computing
10. Ability to undertake small research tasks and projects
11. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture (if
desired)
12. An understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (CSE) program - the general
regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document. These regulations are in
addition to the regulations of the B.Tech. program.
2.
Program Structure
1. The Foundation program provides the basic knowledge about Computer Science (CS)
through a set of core courses, which are compulsory for all students. This program consists of
four major streams: software, hardware, theory, and systems. Besides these, there are courses
in Maths, communication skills, environment studies also as part of the core program.
2. The set of core courses are shown in the table below (courses mentioned in [ ] are

Regulations for the BTech (CSE) Program
1.
Preamble
IIIT Delhi aims to encourage research and innovation in Information Technology (IT) and allied
areas. The objective of the BTech program in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is to
prepare students to undertake careers involving innovation and problem solving using
computational techniques and technologies, or to undertake advanced studies for research careers
or to take up Entrepreneurship.
In order to give due importance to applied as well as theoretical aspects of computing, the
curriculum for the BTech (CSE) program covers most of the foundational aspects of computing
sciences, and also develops in students the engineering skills for problem solving using computing
sciences.
Most engineering programs start with general courses in Sciences, and then migrate to specialized
courses for the disciplines. While these courses are indeed foundational for many engineering
disciplines, they can be treated as application domains (as is evidenced from the fact that most
sciences and Engineering disciplines heavily use computing now). Hence, the BTech (CSE)
program at IIIT-Delhi starts with computing oriented courses first, and allows the possibility of
doing science courses later. Besides being better suited for a CSE program, it also enables the
possibility of students seeing newer applications and possibilities of using computing in these
subjects.
With this approach, the BTech(CSE) program can be divided broadly in two halves. The first half
focuses on building the foundations, and is highly structured. The second part is for developing
the skills and knowledge of the students in various topics - computing and application domains.
This part also provides limited specializations, and different students may follow different paths
and take different set of courses in it. Overall objectives of the B.Tech.(CSE) program are to help
develop the following attributes in students:
1. Understanding of theoretical foundations and limits of computing
2. Understanding of computing at different levels of abstraction including circuits and
computer architecture, operating systems, algorithms, and applications.
3. Ability to adapt established models, techniques, algorithms, data structures, etc. for
efficiently solving new problems
4. Ability to design, implement, and evaluate computer based system or application to meet
the desired needs using modern tools and methodologies
5. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal
6. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
7. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audience
8. Ability to self learn and engage in life-long learning
2
9. Understanding and ability to use advanced techniques and tools in different areas of
computing
10. Ability to undertake small research tasks and projects
11. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture (if
desired)
12. An understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the BTech(CSE) program - the general
regulations for the BTech program are given in a separate document. These regulations are in
addition to the regulations of the BTech program.
2.
The Foundation Program and Core Courses
1. The Foundation program provides the basic knowledge about CS through a set of core
courses, which are compulsory for all students. This program consists of four major streams:
software, hardware, theory, and systems. Besides these, there are courses in Maths,
communication skills, environment studies also as part of the core program.
2. The set of core courses are shown in the table below (courses mentioned in [ ] are electives
and actual courses for these slots are as defined from semester to semester.)

Regulations for B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications
Engineering (ECE)
1.
Preamble
IIIT Delhi aims to encourage research and innovation in Information Technology (IT) and
allied areas. The objective of the B.Tech. program in Electronics and Communications
Engineering (ECE) is to prepare students to undertake careers involving innovation and
problem solving using suitable techniques and hardware and software technologies, or to
undertake advanced studies for research careers.
In order to give due importance to apply as well as theoretical aspects of ECE, the
curriculum for the B.Tech. (ECE) program covers most of the foundational aspects and also
develops in students the engineering skills for problem solving. Towards this, the B.Tech.
(ECE) program at IIIT-Delhi starts with computing and Electronics courses first, and
allows the possibility of doing science courses later. Besides being better suited for
developing engineering capabilities, it also enables the possibility of students seeing newer
applications and possibilities of using computing and electronics in these subjects.
The first year of the ECE program is common with CSE - this allows flexibility to students
in moving from one program to the other. The second year program is relatively fixed,
comprising mostly of core courses for the program. 3rd year onwards the program can be
mostly flexible comprising of electives, which may be organized as streams, including in
Computer Science as well as domain areas.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (ECE) program - the
general regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document. These
regulations are in addition to the general regulations of the B.Tech. program.

2.4 The semester mentioned for the core courses is indicative and suggested, and they can be
done later/earlier also. However, the pre-requisite requirements must be kept in mind by a
student, if he/she wishes to do a core course in some other semester.
2.5 Program structure in 3rd and 4th Years.
2.6 Most courses in Semester 5-8 are electives (an elective course is one which is not
compulsory, and a student may have choices from which to select the courses he/she wants
to do). Core Electives mentioned in Semester 5 are the highly recommended electives,
however are not compulsory (core) courses.
2.7 Some of the electives may be organized as streams, where a stream is a sequence of
courses in an area providing a limited specialization in that area. Streams allow the student
to focus on some area of ECE - as ECE is too diverse it is not possible for a student to gain
a decent mastery in all. Streams allow the student to focus on a chosen area to gain a level
of depth, and gain some understanding of other areas by doing some courses from other
streams.
2.8 Besides electives and streams for specialized areas, streams and electives from domain
areas (e.g. health, life sciences, finance, economics, E-Governance, sciences, etc.) may also
be offered. A student may also be able to take CSE courses.
Note: Streams in the UG programs will not be shown on the transcript. However, the
students may be guided about the courses belonging to a certain area during the course
counseling session conducted at the beginning of the semester. Guidance on streams may
also be put up on the website for information of the students.
2.9 There will also be a set of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) courses offered.
2.10 List of courses, and further information about the courses is available on the website:

Regulations for B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications
Engineering (ECE)
1.
Preamble
IIIT Delhi aims to encourage research and innovation in Information Technology (IT) and
allied areas. The objective of the B.Tech. program in Electronics and Communications
Engineering (ECE) is to prepare students to undertake careers involving innovation and
problem solving using suitable techniques and hardware and software technologies, or to
undertake advanced studies for research careers.
In order to give due importance to apply as well as theoretical aspects of ECE, the
curriculum for the B.Tech. (ECE) program covers most of the foundational aspects and also
develops in students the engineering skills for problem solving. Towards this, the B.Tech.
(ECE) program at IIIT-Delhi starts with computing and Electronics courses first, and
allows the possibility of doing science courses later. Besides being better suited for
developing engineering capabilities, it also enables the possibility of students seeing newer
applications and possibilities of using computing and electronics in these subjects.
The first year of the ECE program is common with CSE - this allows flexibility to students
in moving from one program to the other. The second year program is relatively fixed,
comprising mostly of core courses for the program. 3rd year onwards the program can be
mostly flexible comprising of electives, which may be organized as streams, including in
Computer Science as well as domain areas.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (ECE) program - the
general regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document. These
regulations are in addition to the general regulations of the B.Tech. program.

2.4 The semester mentioned for the core courses is indicative and suggested, and they can be
done later/earlier also. However, the pre-requisite requirements must be kept in mind by a
student, if he/she wishes to do a core course in some other semester.
2.5 Program structure in 3rd and 4th Years.
2.6 Most courses in Semester 5-8 are electives (an elective course is one which is not
compulsory, and a student may have choices from which to select the courses he/she wants
to do). Core Electives mentioned in Semester 5 are the highly recommended electives,
however are not compulsory (core) courses.
2.7 Some of the electives may be organized as streams, where a stream is a sequence of
courses in an area providing a limited specialization in that area. Streams allow the student
to focus on some area of ECE - as ECE is too diverse it is not possible for a student to gain
a decent mastery in all. Streams allow the student to focus on a chosen area to gain a level
of depth, and gain some understanding of other areas by doing some courses from other
streams.
2.8 Besides electives and streams for specialized areas, streams and electives from domain
areas (e.g. health, life sciences, finance, economics, E-Governance, sciences, etc.) may also
be offered. A student may also be able to take CSE courses.
Note: Streams in the UG programs will not be shown on the transcript. However, the
students may be guided about the courses belonging to a certain area during the course
counseling session conducted at the beginning of the semester. Guidance on streams may
also be put up on the website for information of the students.
2.9 There will also be a set of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) courses offered.
2.10 List of courses, and further information about the courses is available on the website:
https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/courses

Regulations for BTech in Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE)
1.
Preamble
IIIT Delhi aims to encourage research and innovation in Information Technology (IT) and allied
areas. The objective of the BTech program in Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE)
is to prepare students to undertake careers involving innovation and problem solving using suitable
techniques and hardware and software technologies, or to undertake advanced studies for research
careers.
In order to give due importance to apply as well as theoretical aspects of ECE, the curriculum for the
BTech (ECE) program covers most of the foundational aspects and also develops in students the
engineering skills for problem solving. Towards this, the BTech (ECE) program at IIIT-Delhi starts
with computing and Electronics courses first, and allows the possibility of doing science courses later.
Besides being better suited for developing engineering capabilities, it also enables the possibility of
students seeing newer applications and possibilities of using computing and electronics in these
subjects.
The first year of the ECE program is common with CSE - this allows flexibility to students in moving
from one to the other. The second year program is relatively fixed, comprising mostly of core courses
for the program. 3rd year onwards the program can be mostly flexible comprising of electives, which
may be organized as streams, including in Computer Science as well as domain areas.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the BTech (ECE) program - the general
regulations for the BTech program are given in a separate document. These regulations are in addition
to the regulations of the BTech program.

2.2 First year courses are common for both ECE and CSE students. All students do one course each in
Maths, Software, Hardware, Systems/practice, and HSS/Comm. All courses, except HSS, are core
courses.
2.3 The semester mentioned for the core courses is indicative and suggested, and they can be done
later/earlier also. However, the pre-requisite requirements must be kept in mind by a student, if he/she
wishes to do a core course in some other semester.
2.4 Program Structure in 3rd/4th Years
Most courses in Semester 5-8 are electives (an elective course is one which is not compulsory, and a
student may have choices from which to select the courses he/she wants to do)
2.5 Some of the electives may be organized as streams, where a stream is a sequence of courses in an
area providing a limited specialization in that area. Streams allow the student to focus on some area
of ECE - as ECE is too diverse it is not possible for a student to gain a decent mastery in all. Streams
allow the student to focus on a chosen area to gain a level of depth, and gain some understanding of
other areas by doing some courses from other streams. A student will be strongly encouraged to
ensure that at least one stream is completed, though is not required to do so.
2.6 Besides electives and streams for specialized areas, streams and electives from domain areas (e.g.
health, life sciences, finance, economics, E-Governance, sciences, etc.) may also be offered. A
student may also be able to take CSE courses.
Note: Streams in the UG programs has now been discontinued. However, the students may
be guided about the courses belonging to a certain area during the course counseling session
conducted at the beginning of the semester. Guidance on streams should also be put on the
website for information of the students.
2.7 There will also be a set of Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) courses offered.

Regulations for B.Tech. Computer Science and Applied
Mathematics (CSAM) Program
1.
Preamble
The increasing use of sophisticated mathematical tools and techniques in tandem with
computational tools in several areas such as computational finance, biology, e-commerce,
weather forecasting, and data science motivates the need for a program that will produce
graduates with computational skills as well as the ability to use sophisticated mathematical
concepts and tools in order to tackle these problems.
The Computer Science and Applied Mathematics program aims to develop such graduates.
The program is similar to the Mathematics and Computing programs operating in many
leading Institutions. The program has a small set of core courses in both Computer Science
and Mathematics, and many electives which can be taken from both the disciplines. This
enables the students to build a program most suitable for them. It is possible for a student of
this program to complete the requirements necessary to appear for the JRF/NET exam in
Mathematical Sciences (including Statistics) jointly conducted by UGC and CSIR, or the
GATE exam in Mathematics/Computer Science.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (CSAM) program - the general
regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document.
Program Objectives: At the end of this program, a student should have:
1. Understanding of foundational topics in Mathematics.
2. Understanding of theoretical foundations and limits of computing and different levels of
abstraction including architecture and operating systems, algorithms, and applications.
3. Ability to design and implement algorithms and data structures for efficiently solving
new problems.
4. Ability to use and apply mathematical and statistical techniques and tools to solve
problems.
5. Ability to abstract and rigorously model and analyze a variety of problems
using appropriate mathematical or computational concepts.
2
In addition, the graduate of this program should also have the following general skills that are

student opting for BTP, may take a total of 8 to 12 credits of BTP spread over minimum
2 semesters, with no more than 8 credits in a semester. A student not completing BTP
credits will have to forgo the partial BTP credits earned earlier and it will not be counted
towards the credit requirement of 156 credits.
Note: A BTP has to spanned at least over 2 regular consecutive semesters (i.e., Monsoon
and Winter) and can spanned at most 3 consecutive semesters. However, in the case of a
gap due to semester leave, the student will be allowed to continue the BTP with the
consent of the advisor.
A detailed document on the guidelines and processes to complete the BTP is available on
this link.
8. A student may take "Independent Project" or "Independent Study" or "Undergraduate
Research" courses for 1, 2, or 4 credits in a semester. No more than 8 of these credits can
count towards satisfying the credit requirements of the degree.
9. A student can take maximum 2, 2xx level courses in 3rd and 4th year. The 2xx level core
courses listed in Semester 5 or later will not count towards this clause.
4. Honors Program
The B.Tech. (CSAM) program has the Honors option, requirements for which are same as
specified in the regulations for the B.Tech. program. Namely;
1. The student must earn an additional 12 discipline credits from in-class courses (i.e. must
complete at least 168 credits).
6
2. The student's program must include a B.Tech. Project.
3. At graduation time, the student must have a CGPA of 8.0 or more.

Regulations for B.Tech. Computer Science and Applied
Mathematics (CSAM) Program
1.
Preamble
The increasing use of sophisticated mathematical tools and techniques in tandem with
computational tools in several areas such as computational finance, biology, e-commerce,
weather forecasting, and data science motivates the need for a program that will produce
graduates with computational skills as well as the ability to use sophisticated mathematical
concepts and tools in order to tackle these problems.
The Computer Science and Applied Mathematics program aims to develop such graduates. The
program is similar to the Mathematics and Computing programs operating in many leading
Institutions. The program has a small set of core courses in both Computer Science and
Mathematics, and many electives which can be taken from both the disciplines. This enables the
students to build a program most suitable for them. It is possible for a student of this program to
complete the requirements necessary to appear for the JRF/NET exam in Mathematical Sciences
(including Statistics) jointly conducted by UGC and CSIR, or the GATE exam in
Mathematics/Computer Science.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (CSAM) program - the general
regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document.
Program Objectives: At the end of this program, a student should have:
1. Understanding of foundational topics in Mathematics.
2. Understanding of theoretical foundations and limits of computing and different levels of
abstraction including architecture and operating systems, algorithms, and applications.
3. Ability to design and implement algorithms and data structures for efficiently solving
new problems.
4. Ability to use and apply mathematical and statistical techniques and tools to solve
problems.
5. Ability to abstract and rigorously model and analyze a variety of problems
using appropriate mathematical or computational concepts.
2
In addition, the graduate of this program should also have the following general skills that are
common with other B.Tech. programs:
6. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal.
7. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
8. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audience.
9. Ability to self-learn and engage in life-long learning.
10. Ability to undertake small research tasks and projects.
11. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture (if
desired).
12. An understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.

Regulations for B.Tech. Computer Science and Applied
Mathematics (CSAM) Program
1.
Preamble
The increasing use of sophisticated mathematical tools and techniques in tandem with
computational tools in several areas such as computational finance, biology, e-commerce,
weather forecasting, and data science motivates the need for a program that will produce
graduates with computational skills as well as the ability to use sophisticated mathematical
concepts and tools in order to tackle these problems.
The Computer Science and Applied Mathematics program aims to develop such graduates.
The program is similar to the Mathematics and Computing programs operating in many
leading Institutions. The program has a small set of core courses in both Computer Science
and Mathematics, and many electives which can be taken from both the disciplines. This
enables the students to build a program most suitable for them. It is possible for a student of
this program to complete the requirements necessary to appear for the JRF/NET exam in
Mathematical Sciences (including Statistics) jointly conducted by UGC and CSIR, or the
GATE exam in Mathematics/Computer Science.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (CSAM) program - the general
regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document.
Program Objectives: At the end of this program, a student should have:
1. Understanding of foundational topics in Mathematics.
2. Understanding of theoretical foundations and limits of computing and different levels of
abstraction including architecture and operating systems, algorithms, and applications.
3. Ability to design and implement algorithms and data structures for efficiently solving
new problems.
4. Ability to use and apply mathematical and statistical techniques and tools to solve
problems.
5. Ability to abstract and rigorously model and analyze a variety of problems
using appropriate mathematical or computational concepts.
2
In addition, the graduate of this program should also have the following general skills that are
common with other B.Tech. programs:
6. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal.
7. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
8. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audience.
9. Ability to self-learn and engage in life-long learning.
10. Ability to undertake small research tasks and projects.
11. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture (if
desired).
12. An understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.
This document specifies the specific regulations for B.Tech. (CSAM) program-the general
regulations for the B.Tech. Program are given in a separate document.
2. Program Structure
1. The B.Tech. program at IIIT-D follows the philosophy of having a small set of core courses
and many electives allowing students significant flexibility in designing their curriculum
and specialization. The overall program structure is given in the table below. The first
semester courses are common with other B.Tech. programs,-this allows change of discipline
after 1st Semester. Semester 2-4 is mostly core courses. In the 3rd year, there are some core
courses and rest are electives. In the final year, all courses are electives (except special
electives, other electives are not mentioned in the table.) In the program below, the
placement of courses in semester is only indicative and not a part of the requirements.

Preamble
With internet expanding in all spheres of life, and most industries increasing their web
presence and interactivity with their stakeholders and customers, demand for incorporating
good design using rich media is increasing in all businesses. With increasing focus on user
experience, the importance of Interaction Design and Design Methods is also increasing
rapidly in IT products and services.
The B.Tech. in Computer Science and Design (CSD) aims to develop graduates that are not
only well versed with computing approaches, tools, and technologies, but are also
experienced with Design approaches. The program has a small set of core courses in
Computer Science (CS) and in Design disciplines, followed by electives from CS as well as
Design disciplines. This enables the students to build a program most suitable for them.

Regulations for M.Tech. in Computational Biology (CB)
Preamble:
The genomic revolution in biology enables one to answer many questions in medical sciences like
personalized medicine, the etiology of diseases like cancer, HIV, etc. However, the answers to
these questions are impossible without a support of powerful computational and statistical tools
that helps to understand and uncover the underlying network design principles responsible for
these diseases. With the advent of new biotechnological techniques massive amounts of genomics
data are generated at a rapid pace from the experiments and the analysis of these data requires
tremendous amount of domain knowledge, solid computational background and strong
programming skills. The entry cost of this highly interdisciplinary field consists of a good amount
of understanding of molecular biology, genomics, algorithms, programming, statistical
computation, machine learning, stochastic processes, and other mathematical techniques that
underlie biological design principles. Therefore, it is imperative to stitch biology, statistics,
algorithms and mathematical models to analyze and interpret large-scale genomic and biological
data. Though the need and potential applications of computational biology and bioinformatics is
tremendous in India, currently very few groups have strength and capability in this area. IIIT-
Delhi, with its strong focus on research, and already having a good faculty in various CS and EE,
is well suited to build a strong theoretical M.Tech. program in Computational Biology.
Program Requirements: In the M.Tech. CB program, the student will do 32 credits of course
work and 16 credits for a Thesis, for a total of 48 credits. In addition to 48 credits a student has to

Regulations for MTech in Computational Biology (CB)
Preamble
The genomic revolution in biology enables one to answer many questions in medical sciences like
personalized medicine, the etiology of diseases like cancer, HIV, SARS etc, etc. However, answers to
these questions are impossible without the support of powerful computational and statistical tools that
helps to understand and uncover the underlying systems level regulatory mechanisms (such as network
design principles) responsible for diseases. With the advent of new biotechnological techniques,
massive amounts of genomics data are generated at a rapid pace from the experiments and analysis of
these data requires tremendous amount of domain knowledge, solid computational background and
good programming skills. This has led to the development of a highly interdisciplinary field of
Computational Biology and Bioinformatics which consists of a good amount of understanding of
molecular biology, genomics, algorithms, programming, statistical computation, machine learning,
stochastic processes, and other mathematical techniques that underlie biological design principles.
For developing skilled manpower for this field, an interdisciplinary program is needed which combine
suitable aspects of biology, statistics, algorithms and mathematical models to analyze large-scale
genomic and biological data in one program in a focused and strategic manner.
Currently few Institutions have strength and capability to offer interdisciplinary education in this area.
IIIT-Delhi, with its strong focus on research, and with a good faculty in various CS and EE as well as
Computational Biology, is well suited to offer such an interdisciplinary program of computing and
biology. The proposed MTech program aims to train students in the key aspects of computing, bio
informatics, and analysis of biological systems through the use of modeling and analytics.
Structure of the Program
The program will focus on strengthening key computer science capabilities needed for solving biology
problems, and in developing skills in bio-informatics, techniques for modeling biological systems,
analysis approaches for biological data, etc.
As this is an interdisciplinary program, it will have some modules to build the basic foundations in the
two disciplines. These modules will be compulsory but will not count towards the credit requirement.
Current modules are mentioned here. The PGC can modify these modules, or add/delete them.
 One intensive refresher course on Programming and Data Structures, and one refresher modules
on Cell Biology and Biochemistry. (These are to be done during the summer before the start of
the first semester).
Refresher module on Advanced Programming and Technical Communication, to be done during the
first two semesters.
In the MTech program, the student will do 32 credits of courses (in addition to the courses mentioned
above), and 16 credits for a Thesis, for a total of 48 credits. For courses, up to 12 credits can be from
2
CSE courses from a list of courses approved by the PG Committee. Some of them may be compulsory.
Any compulsory course may be added to M.Tech. (CB) program only with the prior approval of the
PGC Currently the list of approved courses is:
a. Graduate Algorithms (or equivalent) - Compulsory
b. HipC
c. Machine learning
d. Bigdata analytics
e. Probabilistic Graph models
The student will have to do a minimum of 20 credits of course work in Computational Biology - a few
will be compulsory as defined by PG Committee, others will be electives. A sample of list of courses
is given below - this list will evolve over time.
a. Foundations of Modern biology
b. Practical Bioinformatics
c. Systems and Synthetic Biology
d. Introduction to mathematical biology
e. Stochastic Simulations in Systems Biology and Biophysics
f. Molecular mechanics and Biological physics
g. Computational Neuroscience
h. Biostatistics
i. Function Genomics and Data mining
j. Cell Biology and Biochemistry*
In electives, at most 4 credits of "Independent Study/Project" can be taken.
Thesis: Student will be required to do a thesis in Computational Biology - there is no scholarly paper
option.
For the thesis credits, though the student has to register, he/she need not be physically present and can
do the work while being outside the Institute
Note: A subset of these courses will be used for Minor in CB for BTech students.
Fee Waiver and Scholarships:
The institute will reduce the overall MTech fee by half for students in the first batch. The Institute
hopes to find scholarships for students through DBT.

Regulations for B.Tech. in Computer Science and Social Sciences
(CSSS) Program
1. Preamble
The B.Tech. program in Computer Science and Social Sciences (CSSS) is born out of a
recognition that professionals of either discipline often realise in practice the methodological
tools and the thinking apparatus needed to solve many important problems are to be found in the
other discipline. This in turn can be a formidable barrier in the practice of their epistemic work.
With the growing convergence of information technology with social systems, the role that social
sciences play in the development of technology and business solutions is also increasing.
Symmetrically, the role that information technology plays in addressing social problems is also
increasing. The value proposition of this program, therefore, is this complementarity. That is,
students interested in pursuing Computer Science can do Computer Science better with a training
in Social Sciences; and at the same time, students interested in Social Sciences can do Social
Sciences better with a good training in Computer Science.
In B.Tech. CSSS, social sciences comprise of the following disciplines: economics,
sociology/anthropology, psychology, and liberal arts, communication and humanities. Within the
program, students are offered two broad options. One is to earn a major in one of the above
disciplines in conjunction with computer science. The other is to opt for a portfolio of courses
across all social science disciplines while taking the same set of computer science courses. The
program structure is motivated by the fact that the skill-set required to address social problems
can only be addressed through an integrated systems approach that requires strong synergies
between computer science and social sciences. A training in this integrated program will open up
several opportunities in the industry, social sector, governance, policy as well as for graduate
school.
The program aims to develop capabilities in Computer Science as well as Social Science. At the
end of the program, a student will have:
1. Understanding of foundations, limits, and capabilities of computing
2. Ability to design and implement efficient software solutions using suitable algorithms,
data structures, and other computing techniques.
3. Understanding the foundations of social sciences and articulating the ways in which
different social science disciplines enhance our understanding of society
4. Ability to use logical reasoning, theoretical perspectives and analytical methods,
including modelling, data collection and evaluation for understanding issues from
different social science perspectives.
5. Ability to synthesize concepts and methods from different social science disciplines and
computing and apply these to address issues relating to society.
In addition, the graduate of this program will also have the following general skills that
are common with other B.Tech. programs:
6. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal.
7. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
8. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audiences.
9. Ability to self-learn and engage in life-long learning.
10. Ability to undertake research tasks and projects.
11. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture.
12. Understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.
2.

Regulations for B.Tech. in Computer Science and Social Sciences
(CSSS) Program
1. Preamble
The B.Tech. program in Computer Science and Social Sciences (CSSS) is born out of a recognition
that professionals of either discipline often realise in practice the methodological tools and the
thinking apparatus needed to solve many important problems are to be found in the other discipline.
This in turn can be a formidable barrier in the practice of their epistemic work.
With the growing convergence of information technology with social systems, the role that social
sciences play in the development of technology and business solutions is also increasing.
Symmetrically, the role that information technology plays in addressing social problems is also
increasing. The value proposition of this program, therefore, is this complementarity. That is,
students interested in pursuing Computer Science can do Computer Science better with a training
in Social Sciences; and at the same time, students interested in Social Sciences can do Social
Sciences better with a good training in Computer Science.
In B.Tech. CSSS, social sciences comprise of the following disciplines: economics,
sociology/anthropology, psychology, and liberal arts, communication and humanities. Within the
program, students are offered two broad options. One is to earn a major in one of the above
disciplines in conjunction with computer science. The other is to opt for a portfolio of courses
across all social science disciplines while taking the same set of computer science courses. The
program structure is motivated by the fact that the skill-set required to address social problems can
only be addressed through an integrated systems approach that requires strong synergies between
computer science and social sciences. A training in this integrated program will open up several
opportunities in the industry, social sector, governance, policy as well as for graduate school.
The program aims to develop capabilities in Computer Science as well as Social Science. At the
end of the program, a student will have:
1. Understanding of foundations, limits, and capabilities of computing
2. Ability to design and implement efficient software solutions using suitable algorithms, data
structures, and other computing techniques.
3. Understanding the foundations of social sciences and articulating the ways in which
different social science disciplines enhance our understanding of society
4. Ability to use logical reasoning, theoretical perspectives and analytical methods, including
modelling, data collection and evaluation for understanding issues from different social
science perspectives.
5. Ability to synthesize concepts and methods from different social science disciplines and
computing and apply these to address issues relating to society.
2
In addition, the graduate of this program will also have the following general skills that are
common with other B.Tech. programs:
6. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal.
7. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
8. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audiences.
9. Ability to self-learn and engage in life-long learning.
10. Ability to undertake research tasks and projects.
11. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture.
12. Understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.
2.
Program Structure
The B.Tech. program at IIIT-D follows a philosophy of having a small set of core-courses,
allowing students significant flexibility in designing their curriculum and specialization.

Regulations for B.Tech. in Computer Science and Social Sciences
(CSSS) Program
1. Preamble
Universities have traditionally separated the study of science and technology from that of the
social sciences and humanities. But today the influence of Science and Technology, particularly
IT, over human lives and societies has increased so dramatically, that this division in knowledge
can no longer be supported.
Going forward we are likely to see even more convergence of IT with social systems, and the
role social sciences will play in technology and business solutions will increase. At the same
time, the role IT will play in addressing society's problems, as well as answering the human
questions posed by social scientists, will increase. This will lead to an increase in demand for IT
experts who are well versed in the social sciences and also of social scientists who understand IT
and apply it innovatively to solve problems in their own domain.
This unique B Tech in Computer Science (CS) and Social Sciences (SS), aims to develop IT
knowledge and expertise in students, with a strong input from relevant social science disciplines.
The program will develop knowledge and capabilities that will allow a student to pursue a career
in IT, or further studies in social science or CS/IT and many interdisciplinary programs. As it is a
4 year program, the B Tech (CSSS) will satisfy the requirements of almost all higher studies
programs in India as well as overseas. It may be an ideal program for those students who like
Social Science but also enjoy Mathematics and Programming or those are not sure if they want to
pursue IT as a career or Social Sciences.
Program Objectives:
The program aims to develop capabilities in Computer Science as well as Social Science. At the
end of the program, a student will have:
1. Understanding of foundations, limits, and capabilities of computing
2. Ability to design and implement efficient software solutions using suitable algorithms,
data structures, and other computing techniques.
3. Understanding of foundations of social sciences and articulate the ways in which
different social science disciplines (at least two) enhance our understanding of society.
4. Ability to use analytical methods, including data collection and evaluation for
understanding issues from different social science perspectives.
2
5. Ability to synthesize concepts and methods from different social science disciplines and
computing and apply these to address issues relating to society.
In addition, the graduate of this program will also have the following general skills that
are common with other B.Tech. programs:
6. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal.
7. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
8. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audiences.
9. Ability to self-learn and engage in life-long learning.
10. Ability to undertake research tasks and projects.
11. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture.
12. Understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.

Regulations for the Dual Degree Program in Computer Science and
Engineering (CSE) and Electronics & Communications Engineering (ECE)
1.
Preamble
Dual degree programs are common in India and most IITs have it. The main motive
behind such a program is to have some of the UG students of an Institute do their
M.Tech. in the same Institute, so the Institute can leverage the training it had provided
and the seamless transition into the M.Tech. program to benefit its research activity, as
well as reduce the duration for earning the M.Tech. degree. Most dual degree programs
allow for both degrees to be earned in five years. IIIT-D's dual degree program follows a
similar approach as many other Institutions.
2.
Admission and Requirements
2.1
Application process for dual degree will be invited after 7th Semester, however it is
advised to the students to plan it after 6th semester so that they can plan the courses
properly to complete it within a year after B.Tech.
2.2
Application Timeline: Application for Dual Degree may be invited immediately after
declaration of the result of 7th Semester (Monsoon semester). Scrutiny, selection of
students, approval by Chair, PG Affairs and declaration of result to be completed before
add/drop of 8th semester (Winter Semester).
2.3
Eligibility: Only students with CGPA of 7.0 or above at the time of applying are eligible
for the program. The job offer will be dropped for the students who have already
received the offer and are selected for dual degree. They will be eligible for the next
placement cycle with the M.Tech. batch as per the current practice.
2.4
Any extra course credits earned during the B.Tech. program beyond what is required for
the B.Tech. degree, up to a maximum of 12 credits, may be counted towards course
credit requirements for the M.Tech. degree. So, a student can do extra courses in 3rd and
4th year (as Honors students do), and get these credits counted towards satisfying the
M.Tech. course credit requirements, provided the courses are such that they can be
counted for M.Tech..
2.5
Students, who have undergone the B.Tech.(CSE), B.Tech.(CS+X) or B.Tech.(ECE)
program of IIIT-D, have the necessary background and strength in foundations for
M.Tech.(CSE) and M.Tech.(ECE) program, respectively. Hence, only upto 12 credits of
core course requirement of the M.Tech. program, which is designed to impart some core
knowledge to students, is deemed to have been satisfied, and the same is waived-off for
the dual degree students for earning their M.Tech.
2
2.6
Mandatory requirement to complete OOPD course can be waived for Dual Degree
students as long as AP is taken by the student during B.Tech.
2.7
Mandatory requirement to complete RM course can be waived for Dual Degree students
as long as RMSSD is taken by the student during B.Tech.
2.8
A dual degree student will be considered as a B.Tech. student till the time he/she
completes the requirements for the same; thereafter he/she will be considered as an
M.Tech. student. The date for each degree will be based on the date of completing the
requirements for that degree.
2.9
The dual degree student must spend at least two semesters as an M.Tech. student.
2.10
A dual degree student must do an M.Tech. thesis, which may be a continuation of the
work done in BTP.
2.11
If the specialization requirements are met, then the dual degree student can apply for
specialization as well. Also, student should not repeat a course already done in B.Tech.
Only new courses need to be done to complete the dual degree requirement.
3. Notes:
3.1
The fee for the M.Tech. portion of the dual degree program will be half of regular
M.Tech. fee.
3.2
If a student does 12 credits extra in 3rd/4th years, as allowed, he/she will have to do 8
credits more in the 5th year, and at least 16 credits of M.Tech. thesis, for the M.Tech.
degree. The minimum number of credits for M.Tech. part under Dual Degree program is
36.
3.3
After declaration of 8th semester results the student should specify which courses should
count for B.Tech. and which for the M.Tech. degree.
3.4
Students should be encouraged to take GATE in their 4th year to benefit from the scheme.
3.5
It is clarified that after admission to Dual Degree program the student is ineligible for
placement. No refund of fee will be made if he / she does not join except if he/she goes
for higher studies in which case some amount is deducted (the amount to be deducted
will be decided by the Competent Authority).
3.6
On completion of B.Tech. requirements, the B.Tech. degree may be given on submission
of No Dues Certificate.
3.7
If he/she cannot complete the M.Tech. part of the Dual Degree program no fee refund
can be made.

Regulations for B.Tech. in Computer Science and Biosciences
(CSB) Program
1. Preamble
With the advent of high-throughput techniques, biological sciences are grappling with a
paradigm shift towards data-intensive explorations and challenges for management and
analysis of massive data. Apart from fundamental contributions to basic science, data-
driven analysis in biology has the potential to conquer challenges such as modeling and
control of complex diseases, management and diagnosis of pathologies, personalized
medicine, and drug and vaccine design, among others. Making progress on these frontiers
requires insight into biological processes, algorithms, machine learning techniques,
mathematical modeling, apart from numerical and programming skills.
Thus, interdisciplinary education that imparts knowledge of foundations of biology and
computer science as well as training in modeling and analysis of biomedical data is the key
to create personnel who can provide solutions to problems on the interface of computation
and biology. Knowledge of different aspects of modern biology and computational
sciences will facilitate addressing relevant problems in biology and medicine. Towards
this aim, an undergraduate program that seamlessly integrates foundations of computer
science, biology and mathematics along with training to ask data-driven questions in
biology and medicine is an important step in this direction.
Program Objectives
The program aims to develop capabilities in Computer Sciences as well as in Biosciences. At
the end of the program, a student will have:
1. Understanding of foundations, capabilities and limits of computing.
2. Ability to design and implement efficient software solutions particularly for biological
applications using suitable algorithms, data structures, and other computing
techniques.
3. Understanding of foundations of biological sciences and biological data.
4. Ability to compile, manage and analyze data to address problems in biological and
medical sciences.
5. Ability to build and apply mathematical modeling techniques to biological problems.
In addition, the graduate of this program will also have the following general skills that are
common with other B. Tech. programs:
1. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal.
2. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
3. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audiences.
2
4. Ability to self-learn and engage in life-long learning.
5. Ability to undertake research tasks and projects.
6. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture.
7. Understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (CSB) program - the general
regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document. These regulations are
in addition to the regulations of the B.Tech. program.
3. Program Structure
The B.Tech. program at IIIT-D follows a philosophy of having a small set of core-courses,
allowing students significant flexibility in designing their curriculum and specialization.

Regulations for B.Tech. in Computer Science and Biosciences
(CSB) Program
1. Preamble
With the advent of high-throughput techniques, biological sciences are grappling with a
paradigm shift towards data-intensive explorations and challenges for management and
analysis of massive data. Apart from fundamental contributions to basic science, data-driven
analysis in biology has the potential to conquer challenges such as modeling and control of
complex diseases, management and diagnosis of pathologies, personalized medicine, and
drug and vaccine design, among others. Making progress on these frontiers requires insight
into biological processes, algorithms, machine learning techniques, mathematical modeling,
apart from numerical and programming skills.
Thus, interdisciplinary education that imparts knowledge of foundations of biology and
computer science as well as training in modeling and analysis of biomedical data is the key
to create personnel who can provide solutions to problems on the interface of computation
and biology. Knowledge of different aspects of modern biology and computational sciences
will facilitate addressing relevant problems in biology and medicine. Towards this aim, an
undergraduate program that seamlessly integrates foundations of computer science, biology
and mathematics along with training to ask data-driven questions in biology and medicine
is an important step in this direction.
Program Objectives
The program aims to develop capabilities in Computer Sciences as well as in Biosciences. At
the end of the program, a student will have:
1. Understanding of foundations, capabilities and limits of computing.
2. Ability to design and implement efficient software solutions particularly for biological
applications using suitable algorithms, data structures, and other computing techniques.
3. Understanding of foundations of biological sciences and biological data.
4. Ability to compile, manage and analyze data to address problems in biological and
medical sciences.
5. Ability to build and apply mathematical modeling techniques to biological problems.
In addition, the graduate of this program will also have the following general skills that are
common with other B. Tech. programs:
1. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal.
2. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
3. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audiences.
4. Ability to self-learn and engage in life-long learning.
2
5. Ability to undertake research tasks and projects.
6. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture.
7. Understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (CSB) program - the general
regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document. These regulations are in
addition to the regulations of the B.Tech. program.
3. Program Structure
The B.Tech. program at IIIT-D follows a philosophy of having a small set of core-courses,
allowing students significant flexibility in designing their curriculum and specialization.

Regulations for B.Tech. in Computer Science and Biosciences (CSB) Program
1. Preamble
With the advent of high-throughput techniques, biological sciences are grappling with a
paradigm shift towards data-intensive explorations and challenges for management and
analysis of massive data. Apart from fundamental contributions to basic science, data-
driven analysis in biology has the potential to conquer challenges such as modeling and
control of complex diseases, management and diagnosis of pathologies, personalized
medicine, drug and vaccine design, among others. Making progress on these frontiers
requires insight into biological processes, algorithms, machine learning techniques,
mathematical modeling, apart from numerical and programming skills.
Thus, interdisciplinary education that imparts knowledge of foundations of biology and
computer science as well as training in modeling and analysis of biomedical data is the
key to create personnel who can provide solutions to problems on the interface of
computation and biology. Knowledge of different aspects of modern biology and
computational sciences will facilitate addressing relevant problems in biology and
medicine. Towards this aim, an undergraduate program that seamlessly integrates
foundations of computer science, biology and mathematics along with training to ask
data-driven questions in biology and medicine is an important step in this direction.
2. Program Objectives
The program aims to develop capabilities in Computer Sciences as well as in Biosciences. At
the end of the program, a student will have:
1. Understanding of foundations, capabilities and limits of computing.
2. Ability to design and implement efficient software solutions particularly for biological
applications using suitable algorithms, data structures, and other computing
techniques.
3. Understanding of foundations of biological sciences and biological data.
4. Ability to compile, manage and analyze data to address problems in biological and
medical sciences.
5. Ability to build and apply mathematical modeling techniques to biological problems.
In addition, the graduate of this program will also have the following general skills that are
common with other B. Tech. programs:
1. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal.
2. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
2
3. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audiences.
4. Ability to self-learn and engage in life-long learning.
5. Ability to undertake research tasks and projects.
6. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial
venture.
7. Understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (CSBS) program - the
general regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document. These
regulations are in addition to the regulations of the B.Tech. program.

Version July 2018
========================= 8_Dual Degree (CB)_link0.pdf =========================
Regulations for the Dual Degree Program in Computational Biology (CB)
1. Preamble
Dual degree programs are common in India and most IITs have it. The main motive behind
such a program is to have some of the UG students of an Institute do their M.Tech. in the
same Institute, so the Institute can leverage the training it had provided and the seamless
transition into the M.Tech. program to benefit its research activity, as well as reduce the
duration for earning the M.Tech. degree. Most dual degree programs allow for both degrees
to be earned in five years. IIIT-D's dual degree program follows a similar approach as many
other Institutions.
2. Admission and Requirements
2.1 Application process for dual degree will be invited after 7th Semester, however it is
advised to the students to plan it after 6th semester only so that they can plan the courses
properly to complete it within a year after B.Tech..
2.2 Application Timeline: Application for Dual Degree may be invited immediately after
declaration of the result of 7th Semester (Monsoon semester). Scrutiny, selection of
students, approval by Chair, PG Affairs and declaration of result to be completed before
add/drop of 8th semester (Winter Semester).
2.3 Eligibility: Only students with CGPA of 7.0 or above at the time of applying are eligible
for the program. The job offer will be dropped for the students who have already received
the offer and are selected for dual degree. They will be eligible for the next placement
cycle with the M.Tech. batch as per the current practice.
2.4 Transfer of 12 credits: Any extra course credits earned during the B.Tech. program
beyond what is required for the B.Tech. degree, up to a maximum of 12 credits as
approved for the M.Tech CB program, may be counted towards course credit requirements
for the M.Tech. degree. So, a student can do extra courses in the 3rd and 4th years (as
Honors students do), and get these credits counted towards satisfying the M.Tech. course
credit requirements, provided the courses are such that they can be counted for M.Tech.
2.5 Waiver of 12 credits: Students, who have undergone B.Tech. (CSB) program of IIIT-D,
have the necessary background and strength in foundations for M.Tech.(CB) program.
Hence, only up to 12 credits of the core course requirement of the M.Tech. program, which
is designed to impart some core knowledge to students, is deemed to have been satisfied,
and the same is waived-off for the dual degree students for earning their M.Tech degree.
(a) The following three M.Tech.(CB) core courses will be waived off only for students
of the BTech (CSB) program: a) Cell Biology and Biochemistry (CBB) b) Foundations of
Modern Biology (FoMB) c) Algorithms of Computational Biology (ACB).
Note: As Introduction to Mathematical Biology (IMB) is also a core course for
M.Tech(CB), a dual degree student need to complete this course which is not waived; If
a student has done IMB course as part of B.Tech. program requirement and not able to
transfer that credit with the clause mentioned in 2.4 in this regulation, the student will
have to do a BIO-numbered course in lieu of that.
(b) The core course requirements cannot be waived off for B.Tech (CSE), B.Tech (ECE),
and other B.Tech (CS+X) students, including those who have done a minor in CB.
Though, up to 12 credits can be waived if a student has done BIO-numbered courses in
their undergraduate program (only counting at most one 3xx level and two or more 5xx
level courses). If a student has done M.Tech (CB) core courses as a part of their electives,
then in lieu of these courses, he or she will have to do other courses from the M.Tech (CB)
curriculum.
Note: The courses considered for transferred of credits with the clause 2.4, can't be
considered for waiver.
2.6 Mandatory requirement to complete OOPD course can be waived for Dual Degree
students if they have taken AP during B.Tech.
2.7 Mandatory requirement to complete RM course can be waived for Dual Degree students
if they have taken RMSSD during B.Tech.
2.8 A dual degree student will be considered as a B.Tech. student till the time he/she
completes the requirements for the same; thereafter he/she will be considered as an
M.Tech. student. The date for each degree will be based on the date of completing the
requirements for that degree.
2.9 The dual degree student must spend at least two semesters as an M.Tech. student.
2.10 A dual degree student must do an M.Tech. thesis, which may be a continuation of the
work done in BTP. The goals of the MTech thesis should be aligned with the objectives
of the MTech (CB) program.
3. Notes:
3.1 The fee for the M.Tech. portion of the dual degree program will be half of regular M.Tech.
fee.
3.2 If a student does 12 credits extra in 3rd/4th years, as allowed, he/she will have to do 8
credits more in the 5th year, and at least 16 credits of M.Tech. thesis, for the M.Tech.
degree. The minimum number of credits for M.Tech. part under the Dual Degree program
is 36.
3.3 After the declaration of 8th-semester results, the student should specify which courses
should count for B.Tech. and which for the M.Tech. degree.
3.4 Students should be encouraged to take GATE in their 4th year to benefit from the scheme.
3.5 It is clarified that after admission to the Dual Degree program the student is ineligible for
placement. No refund of the fee will be made if he/she does not join except if he/she goes
for higher studies in which case some amount is deducted (the amount to be deducted will
be decided by the Competent Authority).
3.6 On completion of B.Tech. requirements, the B.Tech. degree may be given on submission
of No Dues Certificate.
3.7 If he/she cannot complete the M.Tech. part of the Dual Degree program, no fee refund
can be made.
3.8 Internship rules for dual degree students will be the same as for M.Tech. students of the
respective batches.

Regulations for B.Tech. in Electronics and VLSI Engineering (EVE)
1.
Preamble
IIIT Delhi aims to encourage research and innovation in Information Technology (IT) and
allied areas. The objective of the B.Tech. program in Electronics and VLSI Engineering
(EVE) is to prepare students to undertake careers involving innovation and problem solving
using suitable techniques and hardware and software technologies, or to undertake
advanced studies for research careers.
In order to give due importance to applied as well as theoretical aspects of EVE, the
curriculum for the B.Tech. (EVE) program covers most of the foundational aspects and
also develops in students the engineering skills for problem solving. Towards this, the
B.Tech. (EVE) program at IIIT-Delhi starts with computing and Electronics courses first,
and allows the possibility of doing science courses later. Besides being better suited for
developing engineering capabilities, it also enables the possibility of students seeing newer
applications and possibilities of using computing and electronics in these subjects.
The first semester of the EVE program is common with all - this allows flexibility to
students in moving from one program to the other. The second and third semester is
common with the ECE program. The fourth and fifth semester of the program is relatively
fixed, comprising mostly core courses for the program. From sixth semester onward the
program can be mostly flexible, consisting of electives.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (EVE) program - the
general regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document. These
regulations are in addition to the general regulations of the B.Tech. program.

Regulations for B.Tech. in Electronics and VLSI Engineering (EVE)
1.
Preamble
IIIT Delhi aims to encourage research and innovation in Information Technology (IT) and
allied areas. The objective of the B.Tech. program in Electronics and VLSI Engineering
(EVE) is to prepare students to undertake careers involving innovation and problem solving
using suitable techniques and hardware and software technologies, or to undertake
advanced studies for research careers.
In order to give due importance to applied as well as theoretical aspects of EVE, the
curriculum for the B.Tech. (EVE) program covers most of the foundational aspects and
also develops in students the engineering skills for problem solving. Towards this, the
B.Tech. (EVE) program at IIIT-Delhi starts with computing and Electronics courses first,
and allows the possibility of doing science courses later. Besides being better suited for
developing engineering capabilities, it also enables the possibility of students seeing newer
applications and possibilities of using computing and electronics in these subjects.
The first semester of the EVE program is common with all - this allows flexibility to
students in moving from one program to the other. The second and third semester is
common with the ECE program. The fourth and fifth semester of the program is relatively
fixed, comprising mostly core courses for the program. From sixth semester onward the
program can be mostly flexible, consisting of electives.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (EVE) program - the
general regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document. These
regulations are in addition to the general regulations of the B.Tech. program.

========================= Centre of Excellence in Human Computing.pdf =========================
Relevance of Human-Centered Computing in the Contemporary World
Human-centered Computing (HCC) combines design principles with Computing to help develop
computing systems that support human capabilities and cater to human needs. As India strives to
achieve sustainable development goals, human-centered Computing becomes increasingly
important in developing technology solutions that holistically support human activities in healthcare,
education, women's safety, and others.
HCC, which is all about an interplay between human-centered design and computing solutions, will
become an integral part of computing solutions for social developmental activities in the future. The
aim is to create technology solutions at the center of the design process. As computing solutions are
increasingly becoming a part of everyday life, e.g., mobile payment apps or essential apps like
Arogya Setu, there is an increasing need for developing solutions that support the user without
requiring the user to learn the technology.
As observed, during demonization, many people with low exposure to technology could not use
mobile payment apps and net banking facilities; human-centered Computing addresses this
challenge by providing design and research methods to develop computing systems that are easy to
use and can be widely adopted.
Future Scope of HCC
Today, human dependence on computing solutions is no longer optional but an unavoidable
necessity. How can one forget that public sector employees were not allowed to travel during the
lockdown unless they had Arogya Setu installed on their mobile phones. Such practices have now
almost become commonplace in most public and private institutions. To develop more innovative
social-technical solutions in various domains, there is a pressing need to promote research activities
in the HCC domain. Going forward, technology, for example, Artificial Intelligence (AI), will only
become more prominent and impact almost every aspect of life or essential services like healthcare,
travel, and education. The HCC will provide the necessary framework for developing intelligent
solutions supporting human activities and enhancing human capability.
Which sectors does it impact, and how
The impact of HCC has been visible in almost every sector where Computing or technology has a
direct interface with humans. Essentially, any technology solutions which interact with human users.
From mobile apps or web-based solutions for reserving a seat in a bus to intelligent systems helping
doctors in analyzing health data or taking online classes is influenced by Human-
Centered Computing.
With the increasing use of smartphones and the ever-increasing reach of the internet, new
demographics are now using computers and the internet to get their work done. Experts of human-
centered Computing believe that computer visualization, human-robot interaction, mixed reality
systems, and mobile and ubiquitous computing, etc., will integrate HCC research for having a larger
impact.
Role of students/researchers in the field
Most of the current-day technology solutions have been developed in the West (as per the needs of
western users) and then are imported. However, we need to develop solutions that serve the needs
of the diverse Indian population and specific Indian context. The students/researchers of HCC will
help in creating knowledge and research methods to develop such solutions. The HCC education and
research allow students/researchers to develop an understanding of how to engage with users,
understand their requirements, develop solutions that meet the requirements, and evaluate them.
Thus, developing robust and scalable solutions that are pluralistic and participatory in nature is the
desired outcome of HCC research and training. Through addressing human priorities with a
commitment to cross-disciplinary rigour, students make research contributions in core fields of
computer science, such as human-computer interaction, computer graphics, visualisation, and
interaction technologies.
Conclusion
HCC is a combination of human-computer interaction, design, and social sciences with the purpose
to develop computing systems for humans in such a way that they support human endeavour
without requiring efforts to learn and therefore help bridge the digital divide. With emerging AI
applications, the need to provide inclusive, transparent, and explainable solutions will rise, the HCC
knowledge research is rightly situated to address these requirements.
========================= Guidelines for Community Work.pdf =========================
COMMUNITY WORK GUIDELINES
Community Work (CW) is a mandatory component for the successful completion of B.Tech. program.
Carrying out of 80 Hours of Community Work enables a student to gain 2 credits. Students can do CW
by doing two activities of 1 Credit each (40 hours) or one activity of 2 Credit (80 hours).
Course Outcomes of Community Work
After completing this course, students will be able to:
CO1: Understand social problems and examine the consequences of structural inequalities on
lives of marginalized populations and groups
CO2: Learn about ideas of social welfare, diverse needs of the community.
CO3: Identify the role that they can play in addressing needs of the community/ group.
CO4: Gain hands-on experience of working on larger societal challenges
CO5: Develop skills for engaging with issues of diversity and social justice
CO6: Conceive/Design interventions for addressing challenges faced by society/communities.
Following steps / check points are to be taken care of towards completion of CW:-
Searching Organization:
The student first needs to find an organisation to work with. The student should decide whether
he/she might be working with an NGO or working on something of their own in a group under
the guidance of a faculty/staff at IIITD.
After discussing with the concerned organisation/faculty/staff, the student must decide on the
number of credits he wants to complete in the particular semester (if he will be registering for 1
credits then he needs to complete 40 hours and if he wants to register for 2 credits then he
needs to complete 80 hours of Community Work).
The goal of the compulsory CW course is to have practical experience of working with the
community by teaching underprivileged students, working with NGOs by distributing stuff
to poor people, helping blind people to prepare some stuff, volunteering for conducting
health camps etc.
Registration on CW Portal:
The student must register their project on the SG/CW portal as per the format. Any information
which could not be completely conveyed in the form must be uploaded as a 'Proposal' file in the
upload files section of the project in this format. The registration for the same must be done
before the add/drop date of the particular semester.
Proposal Approval & Registration on ERP:
After submitting the proposal, the student should wait for a mail accepting their proposal
before starting the work. Once the proposal is accepted, the student must register Community
Work credits on ERP (applicable for 2017 and later batches) by the last date of add/drop and can
continue working on it during the upcoming semester until the semester ends.
Weekly log submission:
While carrying out the Community Work activity, a student has to maintain the log report for
each day. The report should mention the details of work done each day (hourly report), and
should be submitted (after getting it signed by the concerned supervisor) on weekly basis on
the SG/CW portal.
Work Completion:
As soon as the activity is completed, a student has to obtain a completion certificate from the
respective organization / NGO. The certificate should have the stamp and contact no. of the
person incharge from the organization/NGO. Student is also expected to prepare a report and
submit it on the mentioned date which will be one week before the Community work
presentation in the format specified here .
Community Work Presentation:
The report should be submitted at least a week before the day of presentation which will be
held in the beginning of the next semester.
Together with the report, a completion certificate from the organization where he/she
did the CW activity is to be submitted on the portal.
The student also has to prepare a presentation (set of 8-10 slides) /poster .
There will be a presentation every semester (during the first 2-3 weeks, as per the date specified in
the calendar) wherein the student has to present the activity undertaken by him/her. Below is
the semester wise presentation schedule that is to be followed
o Work done in Monsoon Semester - Presentation to be done Winter Semester(as per the
date specified in the calendar)
o Work done in Winter Semester - Presentation to be done Summer Term (as per the
date specified in the calendar)
o Work done in Summer Term - Presentation to be done in Monsoon Semester (as per the
date specified in the calendar)
Note: In case a student fails to follow the above presentation schedule he/she has to start
afresh, by submitting the proposal, taking approval and doing the work again.
Students will also be required to submit the poster / presentation on the portal within 2 days
of the presentation.
The report, presentation and completion certificates, all these documents are mandatory for
the student to be considered for evaluation.
Based on the presentation student will be awarded "S-Satisfactory" or "X-Unsatisfactory". In
case of failure to present the work in the subsequent semester, student will be awarded "X-
Unsatisfactory" grade.
The earned credits will be mentioned in the final transcript.
For any query regarding CW credits students may write to communitywork@iiitd.ac.in or may contact:
Faculty Incharge for CW: Dr. Pravesh Biyani
Academic Officer Incharge for CW: Mr. Ashish Aggarwal
Final Report Structure for CW Activities
Clearly no single report structure will suit all types of work. However, some things
are essential:
Name, Roll Number
Title of the activity, and start date and end date
Details about the NGO: Briefly explain the working of NGO - what do they do? How do
they sustains themselves (in terms of funding)? What is the organizational structure? How
many employees? What are the existing technologies currently in place? etc.
Goals and achievements - In detail describe what the NGO/group wanted you to achieve during
the semester (if a group is formed, this will be one common document) and what you have been
able to achieve.
Plan and adherence - how you planned to achieve the goal. This should be developed based
on discussion with the NGO (again for the group, this will be one common document) and
how was your adherence to the plan all through the activity.
Weekly log - for each week, how many hours were spent, and what specific things were
done in that week. If you had the log on a page include the pictures of your log in your
report itself. Do not create a separate log file.
Certificate from the organization: Include the certificate from the organization as a
picture in your report.
Team Members: List out names of other students who also did the CW with you with
the same NGO (for the group, list out all the group members).
Scope of technology intervention: Based on your experience working with NGO and what
you have learned at IIIT Delhi, briefly explain how IT can play a role in improving upon
the existing activities. If your work involved some technology intervention, please explain
how it will help the organization and how will it be sustained after you finish your activity.
Personal account of experiences including what transformation it has brought in your thinking.
Frequently Asked Questions
1. When can I register for CW? Only at the start of Summer/Monsoon/Winter Semester, or at any
time?
The registration dates for CW work will be same as Add/Drop dates as per the Academic Calendar for
Summer/Monsoon/Winter. No registrations will be allowed after the last date of Add/Drop as per the
calendar.
The students of 2017 batch onwards have to register on ERP as well as SG/CW portal. The students of
batches earlier then 2017, have to register on the portal. The proposal approval status will be reflected on
SG/CW portal within a week's time.
2. Do I have to work with an organisation/NGO? Can't I do some online course related to
community or teach students for free?
The goal of this compulsory course is to have practical experience of working with the community which
isn't achievable by doing online course. As per the report format provided by the institute, you are required
to mention in detail about the organisation/NGO you worked with and also ask for the weekly logs.
3. Can I split my 80/90 hours into 40/50 each and can I do 1 credit of work in one semester and
the other 1 credit in next semester?
Yes, you can split your work.
4. Is it necessary to give presentation right after the semester following the completion of CW
work?
Poster presentation dates are notified in the Academic Calendar of each semester. It is mandatory to present
your work in the subsequent semester.
5. Are Powerpoint presentations / slides acceptable during presentation?
No. You need to make a poster on chart paper or you can take printouts and pin them on the board. The idea
is to nicely present your work done. We don't expect a fancy poster, but your presentation should be
informative and professional.
6. Can I skip presentations?
No. It's mandatory to present, based on which final evaluation is done. Without the presentation, your CW
credit requirements cannot be fulfilled.
7. Is there a list of NGOs through which I can complete my CW requirements?
Visit the portal and there you can see list of registered NGOs and also the example CW project reports for
reference. In case your NGO is not listed, the respective TA will check it and verify your proposal.
8. Would my work at the summer school in IIITD count toward CW
credits? Yes.
9. I am not able to get a stamp on my certificate from organization.
In special cases only, we allow a student to request the organization to write a formal mail validating
student's work and student is then supposed to forward the same to communitywork@iiitd.ac.in , faculty in-
charge and Academic Officer Incharge.
10. Can I work for an NGO outside
Delhi? Yes.
11. Can I do CW in Monsoon/Winter or is it only permitted in the Summer session?
There are no restrictions regarding the scheduling of CW work. If you can manage the workload during the
regular semester, you may choose to do so. Your logs are verified against 80/90 or 40/50 hours requirement
for 2 or 1 credits respectively.
12. After approval of proposal, is there a time limit within which I need to present my CW
work? Please see Q3 in this FAQ.
13. When is the latest semester when I can present my CW work?
If you wish to graduate in June, you should have presented your work in the preceding Winter semester
(i.e., your 8th semester). Therefore you need to plan accordingly and submit your CW proposal at the
commencement of your 7th semester. There will be only one presentation in a semester, typically scheduled
in the first month (as notified in the Academic Calendar).

SELF GROWTH GUIDELINES
Self Growth (SG) is a mandatory component of the B.Tech program at IIIT-Delhi. Its aim is to help
students learn extra-curricular / specialized skills or activities. At IIIT-Delhi, students have to do a
minimum 80 hours of Self Growth Work, with an option of splitting the self growth into 2 activities of
40 hours each for 1 credit each. This helps student advance or even add to their skill sets new abilities
which may range from language, sports, art, music, cooking or any specialized skill, thereby enhancing
the students' abilities apart from just academics. At IIIT Delhi we believe in adding value to a student's
life and enhancing the student holistically
Course Outcomes of Self Growth
After completing this course, students will be able to:
CO1: To identify quantifiable goals for basic proficiency in a new skill
CO2: To gain basic understanding of tools, techniques, and repertoire necessary for
developing basic proficiency.
CO3: to be able to demonstrate proficiency in the identified skills.
Credits: 2
Minimum no. of hours: 80-90
Proposal Format: here
Report Format: here
Searching Organization:
Student need to first finalize an organization to work with. Students may also work on something on
their own (in a group), under the guidance of a faculty
Registration on SG Portal:
SG registration is to be done on ERP as well as on SG/CW Portal (http://sgcw.iiitd.edu.in/) during the
Add/Drop period of a semester.
Proposal Submission
A detailed Self Growth proposal is to be submitted on SG/CW portal a week before the add/drop. The
proposal should include the organization details, nature of work to be done, etc.
Proposal Approval
For 2017 batch: The students will be able to check the approval status of his / her proposal within a
week after the submission, on SG/CW portal login. After the approval, the student has to register for
SG on ERP during the Add/Drop. If the proposal is accepted, the student may start working in the
present semester and has to present the work (mandatorily) in the subsequent semester
For 2016 and previous batches: The students will be able to check the approval status of his / her
proposal within a week after the submission, on SG/CW portal login. If the proposal is accepted, the
student may start working in the present semester and has to present the work (mandatorily) in the
subsequent semester.
Weekly log submission:
While carrying out the Self Growth activity, a student has to maintain the log report for each day. The
report should mention the details of work done each day (hourly report), and should be submitted (after
getting it signed by the concerned supervisor) on weekly basis on the SG/CW portal.
Work Completion:
A minimum of 80 Hours of activity should be completed while carrying out the Self Growth. Please see
below to know the format of report. As soon as the activity is completed, a student has to obtain a
completion certificate from the respective organization. The certificate should have the stamp and
contact no. of the person incharge from the organization.
Final Presentation/Demonstration:
Once it has been verified, you need to give demonstration of the learnt/ acquired SG activity/ skill
which is then evaluated by the SG faculty in-charge. The demonstration need to be done in the second
week of Monsoon/Winter semester (as per the dates mentioned in the calendar). Work done in Summer
Term need to presented in the immediate next Monsoon Semester, work done in Monsoon need to be
presented in the immediate next Winter Semester and the work done in Winter Semester need to
presented in the immediate next Summer Term. Based on the presentation student will be awarded "S-
Satisfactory" or "X-Unsatisfactory". In case of failure to present the work in the subsequent semester,
student will be awarded "X-Unsatisfactory" grade.
For any query regarding SG credits students may write to selfgrowth@iiitd.ac.in or may contact:
Faculty Incharge for SG: Dr. Anuj Grover
Academic Officer Incharge for SG: Mr Ravi Bhasin/Ms. Anshu Dureja
Final Report Structure for SG Activities
Clearly no single report structure will suit all types of work. However, some things are essential:
1. Title of the activity, and name, roll no, of the student
2. Initial capabilities/skills in this area
3. Goals and achievements - In detail describe what you wanted to achieve with the activity and
what you have been able to achieve.
4. Plan and adherence - how you planned to achieve the goal and how was your adherence to the
plan all through the activity.
5. Weekly log - for each week, how many hours were spent, and what specific things were done in
that week
6. Propose extensions: How you plan to extend your current activity into the future and build upon
it.
7. If you have pictures of you doing that SG activity you can always add them.
8. Certificates will be the part of report only.
9. Once the report is made, it should be converted to pdf format and uploaded.
Frequently Asked Questions
1. When can I register for SG? Only at the start of Summer/Monsoon/Winter Semester, or
at any time?
The registration dates for SG work will be same as Add/Drop dates as per the Academic
Calendar for Summer/Monsoon/Winter. No registrations will be allowed after the last date of
Add/Drop as per the calendar.
The best semester to pursue SG is the summers as the students have good amount of time to
dedicate to the training of the SG activity.
You have to register on the portal (by submitting the proposal) in the last week of
April/July/December for Summer Term/ Monsoon Semester/ Winter Semester respectively, and
then check the portal after 2-3 days. If your request for proposal is not approved then drop a
mail to Self Growth email id (selfgrowth@iiitd.ac.in)
2. Do I have to get training by an instructor in person? Can't I do some online course
related to SG for free?
The goal of this compulsory course is to have practical experience and acquiring the skill in
person which isn't achievable by doing online course. As per the report format provided by the
institute, you are required to mention in detail about the organization/trainer/instructor you
worked with and also asks for the weekly logs.
3. Can I split my 80/90 hours into 40/50 each and can I do 1 credit of work in one semester
and the other 1 credit in next semester?
Yes you can split your work.
4. Is it necessary to give demo right after the semester following the completion of SG
training?
SG work demonstration dates are announced in the beginning of every semester. It is
mandatory to present your work in the semester following the completion of SG work. For this,
you need to fill out the form (that will be shared at the end of Monsoon and Winter Semester),
after which your documents will be verified and if found correct, you will be allowed to
present.
5. Are Powerpoint presentations/slides acceptable during presentation?
Yes. Along with the practical demonstration of the skill. For some skills for which the demo is
not possible (Eg. Swimming) the students needs to submit a certificate of completion of the
course and also the pictures of practice and progress every week in the power point
presentation.
6. Can I skip presentations?
No. It's mandatory to present, based on which final evaluation is done. Without the
presentation, your SG credit requirements cannot be fulfilled.
7. Would my work at the summer school in IIITD count toward SG credits?
No, it can be counted towards CW credits.
8. I am not able to get a stamp on my certificate from organization.
In special cases only we allow student to ask the organization to write a formal mail validating
student's work and student is supposed to forward the same to selfgrowth@iiitd.ac.in, faculty
in-charge and Manager, Academics.
9. Can I do my work outside Delhi?
Yes
10. Can I do SG in Monsoon/Winter or is it only permitted in the Summer session?
There are no restrictions regarding the scheduling of SG work. If you can manage the workload
during the regular semester, you may choose to do so. Your logs are verified against 80/90 or
40/50 hours requirement for 2 or 1 credits respectively.
11. After approval of proposal, is there a time limit within which I need to present my SG
work?
Please see Q3 in this FAQ.
12. When is the latest semester when I can present my SG work?
If you wish to graduate in June, you should have presented your work in the preceding winter
semester (i.e., your 8th semester). Therefore you need to plan accordingly and submit your SG
proposal before the end of your 7th semester. There will be only one presentation in a semester
(One each in Monsoon, Winter and Summer Semester),, typically scheduled in the first half.
13. Will my course fee be reimbursed by the institute?
The Institute has made a provision of reimbursing half the course fee for some activities.
Student may contact AM(Student Affairs) or JM(Academics) for more details. For
reimbursement, you would also need to submit an original receipt of the paid course fee.
========================= Guidelines for TA Performance, Attendance & Policy UG & PG.pdf =========================
TA Performance, Attendance & Leave Policy PG & UG
[TAs are expected to do 10-12 hours of TA duty per week]
PG (Ph.D.)
Ph.D. students are operated through a separate leave portal(https://leave.iiitd.edu.in/) where their
advisor approves their leaves. If the student is allocated TA work, the student has to take leave
approval from the course instructor over email.
The academic section will take feedback about TAs from faculty members on a monthly basis. If a
Ph.D. TA gets two warnings, then by default s/he will be awarded "X' grade. This will help in sensitizing
the students who are not performing their TA duties. If a Ph.D. student gets an "X" grade in TAship in
one semester, then (s)he will be issued an "Academic Warning".
Further, if any Ph.D. student receives 2 such "Academic Warnings", then his/her registration from the
Ph.D. program will be terminated. Any academic warning /termination letter issued to the Ph.D.
student should also be shared with his/her PhD advisor(s), so that Ph.D. advisor(s) can sensitize the
student about the roles and responsibilities of a TA.
PG (M.Tech.)
M.Tech. TAs are expected to maintain 100% attendance as they are paid stipend through AICTE/DBT
and each month's attendance of the TA needs to be approved on AICTE portal for processing of
stipend. For smooth operation, TAs don't have to mark attendance daily; However, on the day of
assigned TA work, they need to be available mandatorily. In case of medical emergency, student can
apply for Medical Leave through the TA leave portal (https://studentleave.iiitd.edu.in/). At most two
instances of medical leaves per semester may be approved by the competent authority.]
The academic section will collect feedback about the TA performance and attendance from the
instructor at the end of each month. On the first instance of negative feedback, they will be given a
warning over email. On the 2nd and subsequent warnings, their stipend for respective months will be
deducted.
At the end of the semester, the course instructor will assign "S" or "X" grade to the TA based on the
overall performance. The"X" grade will lead to other repercussions for which they need to visit the
internship guidelines available here. As the M.Tech. students register TAship as a course (MSC901 -
Teaching Assistantship) on ERP, assigned grade will be visible in the transcript.
UG
UG TAs are expected to do 10-12 hours of TA duty per week. For smooth operation, TAs don't have
to mark attendance daily; However, on the day of assigned TA work, they need to be available
mandatorily. In case of a medical emergency, student can apply for Medical Leave through the TA
leave portal (https://studentleave.iiitd.edu.in/). At most two instances of medical leaves per semester
may be approved by the competent authority.
The academic section will collect feedback about the TA performance and attendance from the
instructor at the end of each month. On the first instance of negative feedback, they will be given a
warning over email. On the 2nd and subsequent warnings, their stipend for respective months will be
deducted.
At the end of the semester, the course instructor will assign "S" or "X" grade to the TA based on the
overall performance. If the TA receives "X" grade, the TA will be debarred from the TA allocation
process for the subsequent semesters. For credit based TAship, TA will be awarded "X" grade on
transcript. For "paid" TAs, stipend will not be paid.
========================= Guidelines for Various Awards in Convocation.pdf =========================
To encourage students, IIIT-Delhi will present different award to the students enrolled in different
programs.
This will be given to only one student of passing batch every year.
The student with the best academic record and highest CGPA of all the graduating students in the entire
B.Tech. Program. The CGPA will be computed till one decimal digit (rounded off) to determine the
eligibility for the award of Chancellor's Gold Medal. For example. a student is having CGPA of 9.45 and
another one is having CGPA of 9.44 the final CGPA will be considered as 9.5 and 9.4 respectively. If there
are more than one student having equal CGPA, the award will be given to all.
Academic Section will submit a list of eligible student(s) to the Director for his approval with the
recommendation of DOAA.
This medal will be given to the batch topper of each B.Tech. Program
Eexcept to the one who gets the Chancellor's Gold Medal.
The student with the highest CGPA in each B.Tech. Program (batch topper) will be eligible for this
award. The CGPA will be computed till one decimal digit (rounded off) to determine the eligibility for the
award of Institute Silver Medal. If there is more than one student having equal CGPA, the award will be
given to all.
Academic Section will submit a list of eligible student(s) to the Director for his approval with the
recommendation of DOAA.
This will be given to up to one student in each program for the overall performance in curricular and
extracurricular activities.
Students having CGPA of 8.0 or above are eligible.
A student will be evaluated on parameters of academic performance, research and development
activities, extracurricular activities, values, integrity, citizenship, initiatives, and community services
etc.
 DOAA will form a committee within one month after grade moderation. The initial structure of
the committee may comprise of 3 internal faculty members, 2 students (non-graduating batch)
and 1 external member. The Director can change the structure of the committee, if desired. The
Chair of the committee will be nominated by the Director.
 The committee Chair may also send requests to other faculty members of the institute for
seeking nominations.
 The nominations will be accepted till after one month of winter semester results of each year.
Part of the nomination is a short write-up justifying it.
 A student poll, of the graduating batch, will be conducted to take student's input. Each student
will be asked to nominate two students.
 Students can also nominate themselves.
 All nominated names will be made available to the committee. The committee may shortlist
candidates and have interaction with them to come to a decision. The committee will evaluate
all the nominations within one month of the formation of the committee and submit its
recommendation to the Director.
Note: For the awards 1, 2 and 3 above, student(s) becoming eligible for award of degree till 21st
September of a particular year will be eligible for the award in a particular year. For those who
graduate with the degree date of 21st January, they will be considered for the award in the next
Convocation.
BTP award will be given to zero, one, or more (usually not more than three) in each track:.
Engineering, Research, Entrepreneurship and Design.
1. A nomination will be considered for the Best BTP awards if all the evaluation committee members
recommend a BTP for the award. BTP award may be given irrespective of the BTP grade.
2. BTP evaluation committee members will be required to give their nominations and comments for the
Best BTP award through individual forms circulated by the Academic Section after the BTP
presentation of the semester in which the student will complete his BTP.
3. If a BTP is given an award, then all students registered in the BTP will get the award irrespective of
their grades.
4. In case of a joint BTP if in a group of 3 students doing BTP, for example, one student is graduating
in 2019 (X year) and two students are graduating in 2020 (Y year), i.e., X < Y. Then, the B. Tech.
project for the best BTP award nomination will be considered for the earliest graduating year, i.e.,
2019. If this project is selected for BTP award, the two other students who are to graduate in 2020 will
be considered for the award, for the year 2019 in the Convocation year when they will be granted the
degree
If all are graduating in the same year, say 2020 (Y year), then that project will automatically become
eligible to compete in 2020 for the BTP award. To provide a clear indication about the year in which
the award was given, the year will be appended on all the Convocation awards. So the students
securing the award in 2019 and graduating in 2020 will get the award with a mention of 2019 i.e. "BTP
award 2019".
5. In the case of joint BTP award the names of all the students will be printed on the certificates.
These rules will be applicable from 2019 year of graduation and onwards.
Academic Section will submit a list of eligible student(s) to the committee consisting of DOAA, AAC
Chair, Chair PG Affairs and Chair UG Affairs. This committee will recommend the name(s) of the
student(s) to the Director for approval.
Note: As per UG regulations B.Tech. student, who has already completed his/her graduation
requirement (including registration for a minimum of 8 semesters on campus), are allowed to register
for at most two extra courses in only one extra semester to improve his/her CGPA. Such students are
not considered for any award/medal.
This will be given to zero, one, or more students to recognize the excellent academic performance of
the graduating M.Tech. students getting highest CGPA (after grade replacement) in the graduating
batch across all disciplines. The CGPA will be computed till one decimal digit (rounded off) to determine
the eligibility for this award. If there are more than one student having equal CGPA, the award may be
given to all.
Student(s) becoming eligible till 21st September will be awarded ‘Gold Medal for Excellent
Academic Performance' at the Convocation. For those who graduate with the degree date of 21st
January, they will be considered for the award in the next Convocation.
Academic Section will submit a list of eligible student(s) to the Director for his approval with the
recommendation of DOAA.
Note: Dual Degree M.Tech. and Ph.D. students taking on the way M.Tech. will not be eligible for this
award.
This will be given to zero, one, or more (usually not more than two or three) M.Tech. thesis in each
discipline.
 All M.Tech. students including the dual degree M.Tech. students who have done M.Tech.
Thesis will be eligible. (PhD students taking M.Tech. on the way will not be eligible for this
award.)
 Students who will defend their thesis by 21st August will be considered for Best M.Tech. Thesis
Award in the ensuing Convocation.
 Students graduating with 21st January degree date will be considered for this award in the next
convocation.
 The thesis supervisor will nominate the thesis with a justification for Best M.Tech. thesis award
in the thesis evaluation form.
 The nominations will be accepted until 21st August of each year.

After receiving the nominations, AAC will form an evaluation committee consisting of Chair PG
Affairs and M.Tech coordinators. To avoid conflict of interest, the faculty whose student is
nominated for the award should abstain from the decision making process.
 If the thesis is nominated, the examiners (excluding the supervisor and co-supervisors) will be
asked, through an online anonymous questionnaire (Annexure I) about the thesis. The
evaluation committee will look at those responses and decide whether the examiners too agree
with the thesis being good enough to be among the best in IIITD. This process shall give us a
small collection of thesis which are potential awardees.
 The shortlisted students will be required to give a ten minute presentation (in person or through
skype) before the committee.
 The evaluation committee will evaluate all the nominations and submit its recommendation to
the Director by 1st week of September each year.

========================= Internship Guidelines for M.Tech. 2020 and Future Batches (For ECE and CB).pdf =========================
1. Students admitted in the M.Tech. program through the GATE qualification channel, will NOT be
allowed to drop out of TA duty in their regular semesters (Monsoon and Winter semesters) of
their M.Tech. degree program.
2. M.Tech. students (both GATE & NON GATE) are eligible for a 6-month long duration internship,
during the course of their degree program. The internship can take place ONLY in the 4th regular
semester.
3. In case the M.Tech. student enrolling via GATE channel receives such internship opportunity,
his/her TA duty for the fourth semester will be relaxed.
4. M.Tech. students (both GATE & NON GATE) can join the internship only at the beginning of the
semester or immediately after the semester ends.
5. M.Tech. students who completed graduation requirements by the third Semester but do not
have internship opportunities can register for TA'ship in the fourth semester and receive the
stipend. Once registered, they have to complete the TA'ship.
Eligibility for appearing in Internships or Internships + Full Time (FT) Job offer
M.Tech. students (both GATE & NON GATE) will be eligible to appear for internship related processes
starting after the declaration of results of the second semester.
However, to be eligible for the internship interview, the below criteria needs to be fulfilled.
Successful completion of the first year (after the results and grades for TAship are announced) satisfying the
following conditions:
1. The student should have completed 24 credits towards graduation (by doing 12 graduation credits
each in first two semesters) and registered for 8 graduation credits during summer semester after
the 1st year besides successfully completing the OOPD, RM and Refresher Courses. [If a student has
completed more than 24 credits during first two semester, they are not mandatory required to
register for 8 credits in summer semester]
AND
2. Students admitted under GATE based fellowship program should receive 2 S grades (Satisfactory) in
TA duties during the first two regular semesters.
Internship Guidelines (Applicable from M.Tech. 2020 batch)
Eligibility for joining in Internships or Internships + Full Time (FT) Job offer
If the student is offered an internship or Internship + FT offer for the fourth semester, all such offers will
remain provisional unless & until he/she full fills the below mentioned criteria's.
1. The Student will be permitted to go for semester long internship only after completing all the
graduation requirements before joining the internship. In case, a student has not completed the
graduation requirements by the end of 3rd semester, even if an Internship offer (with or without
full time job opportunity) is available for 4th semester, the offer will become invalid. In other
words, such a student will be prohibited from joining the Internship or Internship + FT offer in the
4th semester. In such a condition/scenario, the student will be required to register on campus for
credits and should be available on campus for completing the graduation requirements, if any,
irrespective of the type of credits left for completion (say IP/IS/Thesis). No request for exception
will be entertained in this regard.
2. Student must have a minimum CGPA of 6.5 as per the graduation requirement.
3. Students admitted under GATE based fellowship program must have secured 3 S grades
(Satisfactory) in TA duties during the first three long semesters.
Note: In 57th Senate, it was approved that completion of the thesis is between the advisor(s) and the
student. If a student has completed the 16 credits of M.Tech. Thesis Progress (MTS697z), then the advisor(s)
may allow a student to go for internship, and the student can defend the thesis while being on internship. It
may be noted that the student will be allowed to go for internship only if the advisor(s) recommends it.
Collaborative Thesis with Industry or Academia
Students generally get confused with Internship and collaborative thesis. Collaborative thesis is not same as
internship. Collaborative thesis is a mutual understanding between a student and a faculty, where the faculty
directly gives the student an opportunity to work on a project in collaboration with an industry or academia.
These students will be allowed to participate only in companies offering FT roles (they will not be eligible for
Intern+FT openings).
Guidelines for Collaborative Thesis:
a) For Collaborative thesis, a student has to be in the campus for 1st three regular semesters (with
regular TA work, if admitted through GATE seats) and need to complete the course work (32
credits+ OOPD/RM + Summer refresher). S/he will only be allowed to work from outside campus, if
s/he has completed the coursework. S/he will only be allowed to take thesis credit while working
from outside campus. A student may plan to compete part of thesis credit within campus and
remaining part outside campus in the collaborated organization in consultation with the IIITD
supervisor.
b) Such students should take necessary approvals from the advisor and academic office before
starting their work. The student has to submit the approval of the supervisor to the academic at
least one week before the list of eligible students for internship+FT offer is submitted to placement
office, so that they will be excluded from the list which will be sent to the placement who are
eligible to sit for intern+FT offer.
c) For a collaborative thesis, students will be allowed to work only with those industry/academia
involved in the joint supervision of the thesis.
d) A regular thesis cannot be converted to a collaborative thesis.
Process to be followed
Following process will be followed for Internship and Collaborative Thesis;
a)
The academic office will share the list of eligible students with the placement office after the
declaration of Winter semester results, by 20th of June every year. The placement office will allow
only such students to participate for an internship opening.
b)
The academic office will share the list of eligible students with the placement office after the
declaration of Sem 3 results i.e. by 20th January (this will be a sub-list of the list shared as per pnt
(a). The placement office will allow only such students to join their internship.
c)
After the completion of M.Tech. program, those who have existing offers (Fulltime offers,06
months Internship+ FT, Only 06 months Internship) do have the option to choose their degree
date.
d)
Students who do not have existing offers & are willing to go for 06/11-month internship in
Semester 4 and 5 can ask for an extension in degree date and can choose their degree date. All
other internship rules, as stated above such as "completing the credits by 3rd semester etc." will
be applicable to them.

Collaborative Thesis with Industry or Academia
Students generally get confused with Internship and collaborative thesis. Collaborative thesis is not the same
as an internship. Collaborative thesis is a mutual understanding between a student and a faculty, where the
faculty directly gives the student an opportunity to work on a project in collaboration with an industry or
academia. These students will be allowed to participate only in companies offering FT roles (they will not be
eligible for Intern+FT openings).
Guidelines for Collaborative Thesis:
a) For Collaborative thesis, a student has to be in the campus for 1st three regular semesters (with
regular TA work, if admitted through GATE seats) and need to complete the course work (32 credits+
OOPD/RM + Summer refresher). S/he will only be allowed to work from outside campus, if s/he has
completed the coursework. S/he will only be allowed to take thesis credit while working from outside
campus. A student may plan to compete part of thesis credit within campus and remaining part
outside campus in the collaborated organization in consultation with the IIITD supervisor.
b) Such students should take necessary approvals from the advisor and academic office before starting
their work. The student has to submit the approval of the supervisor to the academic at least one
week before the list of eligible students for internship+FT offer is submitted to placement office, so
that they will be excluded from the list which will be sent to the placement who are eligible to sit for
intern+FT offer.
c) For a collaborative thesis, students will be allowed to work only with those industry/academia
involved in the joint supervision of the thesis.
d) A regular thesis cannot be converted to a collaborative thesis.
Process to be followed
Following process will be followed for Internship and Collaborative Thesis;
a)
The academic office will share the list of eligible students with the placement office after the
declaration of Winter semester results, by 20th of June every year. The placement office will allow
only such students to participate for an internship opening.
b)
The academic office will share the list of eligible students with the placement office after the
declaration of Sem 3 results i.e. by 20th January (this will be a sub-list of the list shared as per pnt
(a). The placement office will allow only such students to join their internship.
c)
After the completion of M.Tech. program, those who have existing offers (Fulltime offers,06 months
Internship + FT, Only 06 months Internship) do have the option to choose their degree date.
d)
Students who do not have existing offers & are willing to go for 06/11-month internship in Semester
4 and 5 can ask for an extension in degree date and can choose their degree date. All other
internship rules, as stated above such as "completing the credits by 3rd semester etc." will be
applicable to them.

During initial semesters:
Registration: The student will be required to register for "M.Tech. Thesis Progress/ M.Tech. Scholarly
Paper Progress/ M.Tech. Capstone Project Progress in multiple of 4 credits on ERP.
M.Tech. Thesis Progress (4 Cr) - MTS697z

letter grade (A,B,C...) for 16 credits of M.Tech. Thesis. Letter grade (A, B, C…) will be awarded by the
advisor through a thesis evaluation form. For SP/CapP, the supervisor will award letter grade while
approving the report.
Conversion:
 For conversion of Thesis to SP/CapP or vice versa; student will take permission from the
supervisor for the number of credits for which the conversion is approved. The grading in such
case will be done accordingly. There will be no change in previous registration; a student availing
this option will have a footnote mentioned about the conversion in his/her transcript.

mtech@iiitd.ac.in for further process.
Registration in ERP

The student needs to register for Thesis online on the ERP. This is basically a two-stage
registration process mentioned as below:
>Login into ERP
(1st Stage) >Click on "Register for Courses tab"
>Select your batch/Term and click on fetch courses
>Register for Thesis/SP/CaP in multiple of 4 credits.
(2nd Stage)> Click on "Other Details tab"
> Under Project registration: you can either fetch the topics already offered by the
faculty or suggest a topic. (If you are suggesting a topic, please ensure that it is not
offered before)
> Then you need to approach the faculty to approve the same

in current semester, you just need to extend the topic from previous semester in project
registration tab. No need to suggest fresh topic again.
2. After registration of courses (Thesis/SP/CapP) of all the credits in multiple of 4 cr. On course
registration window then proceed for project registration. Suppose you are registering for 8
credit of thesis, so you need to register M.Tech. Thesis Progress twice in the course
registration tab. Then proceed for project registration. If you are registering for 4 credit of
thesis, then going for project registration and coming back again to registration tab for
adding 4 more credits of thesis; here the system takes the project registration only for 1st 4
credits, so for other 4 credits you have to again do the project registration.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The problem of sustainable mobility is a complex problem that requires design and optimization, relying on data analytics and interdisciplinary research that includes computer science, artificial intelligence, electronics
engineering, and human-centred design. The Centre of Sustainable Mobility, set up with funding from DKDF, will focus on solving the current challenges of urban transportation in Delhi and the NCR.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the immediate need for a transformative change in the healthcare systems in India. The Centre of Excellence in Healthcare, started last year, is already making an impact in this direction. In response to the ongoing pandemic, the Centre is looking at epidemic modeling for hyperlocal
interventions, ways of developing a robust crowdsourced citizen-centric information system, genomic data analysis, and, in the long run, a comprehensive plan for a sustainable, resilient, and healthy city.
In response to the urgency of the challenges facing the national capital region, IIIT-Delhi is creating new methods of catalyzing hyperlocal solutions. The Institute is actively contributing to the Delhi Research Implementation and Innovation (DRIIV) program supported by the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser, Government of India. The basic philosophy is that of a 'problem-first approach' with an eye on scalability and long-term sustainability.
As part of the endeavor to augment our global connect, the Centre of Excellence on Light Fidelity (LiFi) is being set up to design relevant courses on LiFi, and facilitate capacity building by supporting research collaborations and exchange of experts between India and the EU. TSDSI (Telecommunications Standards Development Society, India) and ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) are anchoring the activities under this initiative from India and the EU, respectively. The IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and
Telecommunications Systems (ANTS) was also organized at IIIT-Delhi in Dec. 2020 in a virtual mode. The theme for the international conference was ‘ICT for connecting humanity'. IIIT-Delhi has signed MOUs with Fast Retailing, GS1, logically.Ai, and several other universities and industries to expand international linkages further. IIITDelhi and IIT Delhi have also signed an MoU to help the two Institutes collaborate and cooperate in various domains.
IIIT-Delhi has always believed in creating and nurturing the spirit of innovation among its faculty and students. The Institute has set up iHub Anubhuti, a Technology Innovation Hub (TiH), under the National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems supported by DST. The TiH intends to establish itself as a hub of research, entrepreneurship, and innovation in the area of Cognitive Computing and Social Sensing and also build a nationwide shared and distributed facility for public research and commercialization.
The Institute takes pride in developing strong linkages with industry. Recently, the Institute has signed MoUs with Logically, a social enterprise based in the UK, Lord Education and Health Society, Population Council, ST Microelectronics, International NV, and many more to carry out research-driven projects. DataKart Centre of Excellence has been established in association with GS1 India to apply Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and other futuristic
technologies to develop tools for image compression, attribute extraction, and improving the quality of product data in the National Product Data Repository.
IIIT-Delhi has also been in sync with the needs of the industry in terms of capacity building. The Institute has started two PG Diploma programs: PG Diploma in Data Science & AI in collaboration with IBM and PG Diploma in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence with Great Learning. The Institute has also started the Professor of Practice category for distinguished professionals who would help in designing/ teaching courses, research, and development activities, setting up research collaborations, promoting industry-institute linkages, entrepreneurshiprelated activities, etc. IIIT-Delhi has also designed a Certificate program in CS teaching that will use experts' talent across the country for improving CS teaching in colleges and other institutions.
The Institute has started its international admission process for all UG and PG programs. It has set up an Office of International Affairs to attract talented international students and facilitate their transition into the IIIT-Delhi ecosystem. The Institute has doubled its international student intake in the last year. To strengthen the bonds with the alumni, the IIIT-Delhi Alumni Association had launched the IIIT-Delhi Foundation USA earlier.

NINTH CONVOCATION
IIIT-Delhi conducted its 9th Convocation virtually due to the COVID19 pandemic. Although we could not traditionally celebrate the students' achievements, the Institute left no stone unturned to ensure that the event was equally inspiring and memorable. This ceremony was a celebration of the accomplishments of the students during their time at IIIT-Delhi.
Professor Joachim Frank (Columbia University, USA), the recipient of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, was the Chief Guest and delivered the Convocation address. Prof. Frank mentioned in his speech, "We have two choices: despair at the overwhelming chaos in the wake of the pandemic, or take it as an opportunity to rethink, in a radical way, the state of affairs and the way things should be run. As someone who had experienced utter chaos once before, at the beginning of his life during World War II, and then experienced the return to civil order, decency, and prosperity in Germany, my country of birth, I'm biased toward the second choice".

CS Teachers should understand not just how to use technology but how to explain
and show students the basis behind
computing tools so that they can create
their own
India has over 10,000 engineering colleges and 100s of degree-granting institutions that focus on engineering. Often the quality of education in many academic institutions is mediocre, primarily due to the background of the faculty. If the quality of education has to improve, teachers in these colleges/universities need to be re-trained through a suitable T3 program.
IIIT-Delhi has designed an online program for CS Teachers to improve teaching. The program will use the talent of experts across the country for enhancing CS teaching in colleges and other institutions. For this, modules on teaching important CS topics have been proposed. These modules will be designed for the teachers who have taught CS a few times. The goal is to improve the teaching capability of the teachers by providing a deeper understanding of concepts and applying concepts for problem-solving. The inclination should be towards developing the capacity to design handson assignments for students, sharing possible labs/assignments/projects/lecture slides, providing other valuable resources, etc. The eventual goal, of course, is that this will then improve the teaching of CS to their students.
The program will be a collaborative effort among the faculty from reputed institutions. In such an arrangement, the teaching load is distributed, and the best experts from these leading institutions are invited to participate. To facilitate this program, IIIT-Delhi has agreed in principle to offer Certificates (and later Post-Graduate Diploma) to participants who complete one or more modules.

Industry Interactions
Collaborations between universities and industry have given life to many disruptive discoveries over the years. There are several examples of fruitful partnerships between
universities, industry partners, and start-ups. Many ideas from research in universities are relevant for industrial innovations. Others reach the market through licensing or start-up companies. Endeavors to find solutions to complex social, environmental, and economic challenges - for example, in energy, environment, health, or security - have
increasingly required collaboration between universities and industry because few organizations have the internal capacity to deliver results independently.
Universities, academics, and their funders also wish to see results from their research put into practice. There is a trend amongst current cohorts of students to explore entrepreneurial careers, often focusing on social
enterprise.
ANNUAL REPORT 2020-21
51
University-industry collaboration requires careful management and can bring many benefits. These include a two-way flow of ideas: results can flow out to industry, and they can also be in-bound to fuel research questions. For example, sometimes technical problems experienced at the cutting-edge of practice lead to new questions for science.
Businesses recognize universities for their rich talent pool and enthusiastic graduate students, while universities recognize businesses as sources of real-world problems, technical know-how, and funding. There are numerous examples of successful research collaborations in computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering.
CONSULTANCY PROJECTS
With their professional knowledge and expertise, the faculty often get involved in consultancy projects that require a relatively short time to address the relevant problems. The Institute facilities are used for carrying out research, theoretical analyses, or experimentation to deliver such consultancy projects. The figures below show the number and sanctioned amount of the projects received over the years. The details of new projects received this year are mentioned in Appendix D.

SCHOOL OUTREACH
IIIT-Delhi continues to increase its outreach activities. This year, the Institute was back with Season 5 of Summer Camp for government school students. The camp was conducted in an online mode, and the students of nearby government schools participated. In order to provide students with better online learning, we did some modifications in the content for both the academic and the activities sessions. There were also some additional modules like Entrepreneurship, Storytelling, and Astronomy.
The structure of delivery for all the modules was such that students were first taught a concept in every session. In the second half of the session, the students were divided into breakout rooms of smaller sizes (6-8 students). In the breakout rooms, they were presented with related activities to brainstorm and indulge in deeper learning of the concept.

Formation of Committees for Decision Making: The Institute has adopted the practice of forming committees to take decisions. The goal in committee formation is to develop a broadly representative group that is inclusive of and yet diverse on many dimensions, including demographic and disciplinary diversity and the diversity of faculty rank, employment status, or student degree program. The committee members are crucial to accomplishing the goals through their invested engagement in relevant problem-solving. Standing Committees: The primary purpose of standing committees at the Institute is to consider and recommend actions and propose policies in the functional areas under their jurisdictions, subject to final approval by the Director. These committees consist of faculty members, officers, RWA representatives, and students, depending on the nature of the committee. Some of the committees formed recently are the Revenue Generation Committee, the Cost Reduction Committee, the Campus Wellbeing Committee, the Covid Care Committee, the Committee for Onboarding Policy for Students, the Committee on Internship and Placement Challenges due to COVID-19. Innovation and Improvement Initiatives in Education: The faculty members at IIIT-Delhi continue to update the curriculum with the emerging trends and implement innovative teaching methods at the Institute. This year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the winter semester of 2020 was partially shifted to the online mode. The faculty adopted a flipped classroom model, and they used Google Classroom to keep in constant touch with students. Lab experimentbased projects were converted to simulation-based projects to cope with this situation. This arrangement helped the students to apply their theoretical understanding in solving real-life problems. One of our faculty member used a simulation platform ‘Gem5' to see the impact of the concepts in performance. Such measures taken by the Institute and the faculty ensured smooth completion of the semester, and the students have appreciated such initiatives. Appendix J contains the detailed list. Onboarding Process for start-ups: IIITD Incubation Centre has augmented the process of onboarding startups to get the best startup companies associated with it and help them during the incubation period.

The second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India had been more devastating than the first. It was different from last year's outbreak in several ways, leading to the complete collapse of India's healthcare system. The pandemic has affected individuals' physical health and took a toll on their mental health.
The second wave of Corona 19 had a considerable impact on IIIT-Delhi staff, faculty members, and residents. However, the Institute made numerous efforts to ensure the safety of its students, faculty, and staff. Despite the outbreak, the Institute could prevent further transmission of the virus on campus by implementing prompt strategies.
The Institute had set up a Covid Care Committee (CCC) last year with the onset of the pandemic to address the issues of its students, faculty, and staff to ensure their safety and health. Covid-appropriate practices were followed at the IIIT-Delhi campus under the guidance of the Covid Care Committee to contain the spread of the virus and support the faculty, staff, and students in their recovery.
Sanitization and Cleanliness Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic hit India, the CCC has been paying particular attention to the cleanliness and hygiene within and around the campus. A dedicated team of FMS personnel has been deployed at the campus that takes care of the daily cleaning and sanitation of the campus, including periodic sanitization of all doorknobs and handles, frequently used areas like lifts, common access corridors, and shared toilets.
The committee also established proper COVID guidelines/protocols within the campus to comply with the government guidelines. These include wearing face masks, maintaining social distance, frequent hand washing, among others. Foot and censor-operated hand sanitizer dispensers were also installed at multiple locations on the campus. As there were a few cases within the campus during the second wave, the FMS team properly sanitized the areas affected by covid.
Restricted entry & movement within the campus Entry to the campus is only allowed via a single gate with a tracking pass to be worn by visitors and students. There is no entry without a mask and proper checking of body temperature using an infrared thermometer for people coming from outside. An entry in the register is being maintained for contact tracing.
During the second wave, the movement of hostellers was restricted to prevent the spread of the virus. The movement of Covid patients in the faculty residence was also controlled through the FMS and security agency, followed by sanitization of such lifts or other areas used by them. Even entry to lab areas was also restricted and was allowed only with prior approval of the HOD. The norms are still being followed until further notice.

For anyone found symptomatic, isolation floors were used in separate buildings for girls and boys. A red zone for isolation was created in hostels for students found symptomatic with mild and moderate levels and the affected students were placed under quarantine.
Affected families at the faculty residences were also isolated and essential goods and services were provided to them by the Covid caregivers' group consisting of FMS members enabling the faculty members affected by Covid-19 to remain in isolation. Covid Docking Station, which was created last year during the first wave, came out to be very useful in the second wave as well. This unit was further augmented by the CCC and the same is in progress. Sufficient stock of PPE kits, medicines and oxygen concentrators is maintained at the docking station at all times.
Covid care facilities and support
The CCC and RWA coordinated with each other on all aspects of the issues to tackle the situation and prevent the spread of the virus, including restricting vendors/couriers up to the ground floor level of the faculty towers. The CCC and Student Affairs also coordinated with each other on all major issues on student-related matters such as onboarding, mental health, and students' well-being. The counselors took sessions online with students to discuss their concerns. Online recreational sessions for yoga, Zumba, aerobics were also organized.
Mental health
A vaccination facility has also been created in collaboration with the nearby Banarsi Das Chandiwala Hospital for faculty and staff members.
The faculty and staff collaborated and donated to set up a free-of-cost vaccination drive for the service providers on campus, such as FMS, security personnels, housemaids, drivers, etc.
IIIT-Delhi has been rigorously making efforts to ensure the safety and health of its students, faculty, and staff and appreciates the initiatives of the Covid Care Committee to curb the spread of the virus on campus in a responsible manner. The Institute is planning to start the onboarding process for students for the next session, keeping in mind the government advisories.

ACADEMIC INITIATIVES
The last year has been a year of disruption and transformation. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the Institute has been regularly conducting the classes online, without compromising on the academic rigor.
The academic section of IIIT-Delhi took proactive steps and held discussions with all Heads of the departments and other functionaries for timely decisions on running the academic activities in an online mode, which eventually proved helpful for the system. Faculty and students participated proactively in online teaching and learning. Faculty conducted classes by sharing short videos and hosting live lectures using Zoom, Google Meet, etc.
To facilitate online learning, the Institute took several proactive measures including internal workshops for online teaching, augmenting online teaching tools/ resources, additional support for economically challenged students, etc.
Tabs provided to the Faculty and Teaching
Assistants
Separate Zoom licenses were
issued to aid in the
management of large classes and use professional features.
Economically challenged
students were reimbursed for
the internet charges
First-year UG students eligible for a 100% fee waiver, i.e., NFS cardholders, were given laptops.
At IIIT-Delhi, technology in education delivery was already well-integrated into the education system, and almost the entire academic management is online. The Institute has an ERP system used for educational, administrative activities like course registration, grade announcements, etc.
Most of the faculty members used Zoom to run classes. Some faculty members have used Wacom Tablets (a writing device), Tablets with a stylus, overhead projectors, etc., to facilitate learning in the virtual medium. As the lectures were recorded on Zoom and Google meet, faculty could share the recorded lessons with the class, which helped the students attend the courses as per their availability or refer to the recorded video later. Some of the faculty also shared online material to cater to the students who faced internet issues.

SAFEGUARDING THE STUDENTS ON CAMPUS
Before the onboarding, the students must submit the self-undertaking cum consent form, which has their sign and the signatures of the parents. The students also need to undergo self-isolation of 14 days/ submit the negative RT-PCR report obtained in the last 48 hours before coming to the hostel to exempt the isolation period. Students are also required to send the e-mail approval of the faculty supervisor/ PI. Pedal-operated sanitiser machines exist at the main campus entry, at the entrance of girls' and boys' hostel, mess and canteen, sports block, etc. There is an isolation floor for emergency purposes (students having a report with COVID Positive) inside the hostel building. The health centre has 24X7 nursing assistance available, with medical practitioners general round the clock for any service. Hostellers are not allowed to move outside the campus without approval. The students should wear the mask, maintain social distancing, and wash their hands regularly; posters with directives are placed inside and outside the hostels and near the washrooms. Caretakers/staff must take regular feedback from the students tested Covid-Positive in case of any requirement. Meeting between all the hostellers and Dean of Student Affairs, Chief Warden, Counsellor, Girls Warden, Manager (Student Affairs) is conducted every week to gauge the requirement of hostellers.

In addition to this initiative, the IIIT-Delhi TiH is currently supporting 28 projects, 15 Ph.D. students, 28 Chanakya UG Fellowships, and 3 Chanakya PG Fellowships.
Collaboration is recognized and appreciated at all levels at IIIT-Delhi - between academic units, between research institutions, and most importantly, with industry. IIIT-Delhi has recently signed an MOU with TCS to collaborate on research areas of mutual interest and explore a new concept of 'flipped internship' where the student will stay at the Institute working on their internship in close interaction with industry collaborators. IIIT-Delhi has forged new partnerships with Electreefi, Applied Solar Technologies (India) Private Limited, Transport Department, Govt. of NCT of Delhi, Department of Biotechnology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, ICMR, and many more to carry out research-driven projects. Under the Industry Outreach Program (IOP), a collaboration has been established with the Japan-based company Fast Retailing (FR), where FR will cover full tuition and related costs for five B.Tech. students and a master's student. An Innovation Lab at IIIT-Delhi is also being set up with support from Samsung. This unique collaboration with Samsung will not only provide support for equipment but also for student fellowships.
IIIT-Delhi and IIT Delhi have signed an MoU that will help both the Institutes collaborate and cooperate in various domains. This MoU enables both the Institutes to jointly guide research candidates registered in either of the Institutes, jointly propose and engage in research and training programs, permit Ph.D. students from one institution to take advanced courses in the other, encourage faculty members from both Institutes to jointly formulate and offer advanced courses available to students from both Institutes, jointly organize seminars, conferences, or workshops on topics of mutual interest, jointly propose centres of excellence which may be spread over the two institutions, etc. To further augment the Institute's global, connect IIIT-Delhi has signed MOUs with Nagasaki University, University of Oulu, University of Naples Federico, Lealand Stanford Junior University, University of Cape Town, University of Trinity, and Central Michigan University. Last year the faculty members collaborated with their peers in over 40 countries that led to co-authored papers, co-advised Ph.D. students, and joint projects.
Entrepreneurial thinking is a mindset, and the Institute focuses on how innovation and entrepreneurship can play a positive socio-economic role in society. The IIIT-Delhi Incubation Centre (IIITDIC) has been selected as one of the PRAYAS Centre under the DST NIDHI PRAYAS scheme. This Centre is one of the first in the National Capital Region.

Most dual degree programs allow for both degrees to be earned in five years. IIIT-D's dual degree program follows a similar approach as many other Institutions.
Only students with a CGPA of 7.0 or above at the time of applying are eligible for the program. Once selected for the Dual Degree, a student cannot avail of placement services that year. Furthermore, a student selected for the Dual degree may opt-out from migration before the add/drop date of their 7th semester in the B.Tech. Program.

PG DIPLOMA IN DATA SCIENCE AND AI
NEW PRORAM STARTED IN 21-22
To cater to IT professionals' upskilling needs and meet the industry requirements, IIIT-Delhi, in collaboration with IBM, had launched a nine-month-long PG Diploma program in Data Science and AI(PGD DS&AI) in 2020.
The online program is conducted on the weekends (including Saturdays and one Sunday every month). It is one of the most comprehensive diploma program enabling professionals from different industry verticals to reboot their careers. Our industry collaboration provides participants with ample opportunities to work on real-life data science projects. IIIT-Delhi faculty members, as well as IBM leaders in Analytics, teach the courses. Towards this goal, an MOU was signed between IIITDelhi and IBM.
CERTIFICATE PROGRAM IN CS TEACHING
India has over 10,000 engineering colleges and 100s of degree-granting institutions that focus on engineering. Often the quality of education in many academic institutions is mediocre, primarily due to the background of the faculty. If the quality of education has to improve, teachers in these colleges/universities need to be re-trained through a suitable T3 program.
IIIT-Delhi has designed an online program for CS Teachers to improve teaching. The program will use the talent of experts across the country for enhancing CS teaching in colleges and other institutions. For this, modules on teaching important CS topics have been proposed. These modules will be designed for the teachers who have taught CS a few times. The goal is to improve the teaching capability of the teachers by providing a deeper understanding of concepts and applying concepts for problem-solving. The inclination should be towards developing the capacity to design hands-on assignments for students, sharing possible labs/assignments/projects/lecture slides, providing other valuable resources, etc. The eventual goal, of course, is that this will then improve the teaching of CS to their students.
The program will be a collaborative effort among the faculty from reputed institutions. In such an arrangement, the teaching load is distributed, and the best experts from these leading institutions are invited to participate. To facilitate this program, IIIT-Delhi has agreed in principle to offer Certificates (and later Post-Graduate Diploma) to participants who complete one or more modules.
In the year 2022 a total of 181 computer science teachers from all across the country has signed up for the programs out of which 152 have already
successfully completed the program
28 students from the first batch have successfully graduated and received
their Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence in the
year 2021-22.

INDUSTRY INTERACTIONS
Innovation and Research
Collaborations between universities and industry have given life to many disruptive discoveries over the years. There are several examples of fruitful partnerships between universities,
industry partners, and start-ups. Many ideas from research in universities are relevant for industrial innovations. Others reach the market through licensing or start-up companies.
Endeavors to find solutions to complex social, environmental, and economic challenges - for example, in energy, environment, health, or security - have increasingly required
collaboration between universities and industry because few organizations have the internal capacity to deliver results independently.
Universities, academics, and their funders also wish to see results from their research put into practice. There is a trend amongst current cohorts of students to explore entrepreneurial careers, often focusing on social enterprise.
ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22
University-industry collaboration requires careful management and can bring many benefits. These include a two-way flow of ideas: results can flow out to industry, and they can also be in-bound to fuel research questions. For example, sometimes technical problems experienced at the cuttingedge of practice lead to new questions for science.
Businesses recognize universities for their rich talent pool and enthusiastic graduate students, while universities recognize businesses as sources of real-world problems, technical know-how, and funding. There are numerous examples of successful research collaborations in computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering.

For many alumni of IIITD, "giving back" isn't just tied to offering monetary gifts to the Institute but it is their way of building a lifelong relationship with their alma mater. Whether the alumni give back through their time, funds, expertise, or professional network, the generosity has helped the Institute tremendously.
One such story of #givingback is of alumna Mridula Singh (M.Tech. CSE, Class of 2014), who is currently working as a tenure track faculty at CISPA - Helmholtz Center for Information Security in Germany. Mridula recently selected two B.Tech. students (one from CSE and one from CSSS) for the internship.
In 2020-21, the Office of Alumni Affairs established a corpus fund named "Alumni Legacy Fund," and the alumni and the graduating batch donated gratuitously to the fund. The office of Alumni Affairs also organized a donation drive, 'Make a Change,' in April 2022, raised support for student welfare, and provided three laptops to students from humble backgrounds.

Formation of Committees for Decision Making: The Institute has adopted the practice of forming committees to make decisions. The goal of committee formation is to develop a broadly representative group that is inclusive of and yet diverse on many dimensions, including demographic and disciplinary diversity and the diversity of faculty rank, employment status, or student degree program. The committee members are crucial to accomplishing the goals through their invested engagement in relevant problem-solving. Standing Committees: The primary purpose of standing committees at the Institute is to consider and recommend actions and propose policies in the functional areas under their jurisdictions, subject to final approval by the Director. These committees consist of faculty members, officers, RWA representatives, and students, depending on the nature of the committee. Some of the committees formed recently are the Revenue Generation Committee, the Cost Reduction Committee, the Campus Wellbeing Committee, the Covid Care Committee, the Committee for Onboarding Policy for Students, and the Committee on Internship and Placement Challenges due to COVID-19.
The administration of universities and how education is delivered have seen a shift in recent years. The emphasis is on adopting processes and principles that were historically only in manufacturing companies and, more recently, the service industry.
IIIT-Delhi has taken many such initiatives and has witnessed noticeable changes in the educational experience, research output, commitment to programs, and improved quality and efficiency.

Covid-Related Initiatives
ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22
The second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India had been more devastating than the first. It was different from last year's outbreak in several ways, leading to the complete collapse of India's healthcare system. The pandemic has affected individuals' physical health and took a toll on their mental health.
The second wave of Corona 19 had a considerable impact on IIIT-Delhi staff, faculty members, and residents. However, the Institute made numerous efforts to ensure the safety of its students, faculty, and staff. Despite the outbreak, the Institute could prevent further transmission of the virus on campus by implementing prompt strategies.
The Institute had set up a Covid Care Committee (CCC) last year with the onset of the pandemic to address the issues of its students, faculty, and staff to ensure their safety and health. Covid-appropriate practices were followed at the IIIT-Delhi campus under the guidance of the Covid Care Committee to contain the spread of the virus and support the faculty, staff, and students in their recovery.
Sanitization and Cleanliness
Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic hit India, the CCC has been paying particular attention to the cleanliness and hygiene within and around the campus. A dedicated team of FMS personnel has been deployed at the campus that takes care of the daily cleaning and sanitation of the campus, including periodic sanitization of all doorknobs and handles, frequently used areas like lifts, common access corridors, and shared toilets.
The committee also established proper COVID guidelines/protocols within the campus to comply with the government guidelines. These include wearing face masks, maintaining social distance, frequent hand washing, among others. Foot and sensor-operated hand sanitizer dispensers were also installed at multiple locations on the campus. As there were a few cases within the campus during the second wave, the FMS team properly sanitized the areas affected by covid.
Restricted entry and movement within the campus
Entry to the campus is only allowed via a single gate with a tracking pass to be worn by visitors and students. There is no entry without a mask and proper checking of body temperature using an infrared thermometer for people coming from outside. An entry in the register is being maintained for contact tracing.
During the second wave, the movement of hostellers was restricted to prevent the spread of the virus. The movement of Covid patients in the faculty residence was also controlled through the FMS and security agency, followed by sanitization of such lifts or other areas used by them. Even entry to lab areas was also restricted and was allowed only with prior approval of the HOD. The norms are still being followed until further notice.
NEW FACILITIES
129
ANNUAL REPORT 2021-22
For anyone found symptomatic, isolation floors were used in separate buildings for girls and boys. A red zone for isolation was created in hostels for students found symptomatic with mild and moderate levels and the affected students were placed under quarantine.
Affected families at the faculty residences were also isolated and essential goods and services were provided to them by the Covid caregivers' group consisting of FMS members enabling the faculty members affected by Covid-19 to remain in isolation. Covid Docking Station, which was created last year during the first wave, came out to be very useful in the second wave as well. This unit was further augmented by the CCC and the same is in progress. Sufficient stock of PPE kits, medicines and oxygen concentrators is maintained at the docking station at all times.
Covid care facilities and support
The CCC and RWA coordinated with each other on all aspects of the issues to tackle the situation and prevent the spread of the virus, including restricting vendors/couriers up to the ground floor level of the faculty towers. The CCC and Student Affairs also coordinated with each other on all major issues on studentrelated matters such as onboarding, mental health, and students' well-being. The counselors took sessions online with students to discuss their concerns. Online recreational sessions for yoga, Zumba, aerobics were also organized.
Mental health
A vaccination facility has also been created in collaboration with the nearby Banarsi Das Chandiwala Hospital for faculty and staff members.
The faculty and staff collaborated and donated to set up a free-ofcost vaccination drive for the service providers on campus, such as FMS, security personnels, housemaids, drivers, etc.
IIIT-Delhi has been rigorously making efforts to ensure the safety and health of its students, faculty, and staff and appreciates the initiatives of the Covid Care Committee to curb the spread of the virus on campus in a responsible manner. The Institute is planning to start the onboarding process for students for the next session, keeping in mind the government advisories.

ACADEMIC INITIATIVES
The last year has been a year of disruption and transformation. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the Institute has been regularly conducting the classes online, without compromising on the academic rigor.
The academic section of IIIT-Delhi took proactive steps and held discussions with all Heads of the departments and other functionaries for timely decisions on running the academic activities in an online mode, which eventually proved helpful for the system. Faculty and students participated proactively in online teaching and learning. Faculty conducted classes by sharing short videos and hosting live lectures using Zoom, Google Meet, etc.
To facilitate online learning, the Institute took several proactive measures including internal workshops for online teaching, augmenting online teaching tools/ resources, additional support for economically challenged students, etc.
Tabs provided
to the Faculty and Teaching
Assistants
Separate Zoom
licenses were
issued to aid in the management of
large classes and use professional
features.
Economically challenged students were
reimbursed for the internet charges
First-year UG
students eligible for a 100% fee waiver, i.e., NFS
cardholders, were
given laptops.
Initiatives by the Academic Section
At IIIT-Delhi, technology in education delivery was already well-integrated into the education system, and almost the entire academic management is online. The Institute has an ERP system used for educational, administrative activities like course registration, grade announcements, etc.
Most of the faculty members used Zoom to run classes. Some faculty members have used Wacom Tablets (a writing device), Tablets with a stylus, overhead projectors, etc., to facilitate learning in the virtual medium. As the lectures were recorded on Zoom and Google meet, faculty could share the recorded lessons with the class, which helped the students attend the courses as per their availability or refer to the recorded video later. Some of the faculty also shared online material to cater to the students who faced internet issues.

SAFEGUARDING THE STUDENTS ON CAMPUS
Before the onboarding, the students must submit the self-undertaking cum consent form, which has their sign and the signatures of the parents. The students also need to undergo self-isolation of 14 days/ submit the negative RT-PCR report obtained in the last 48 hours before coming to the hostel to exempt the isolation period. Students are also required to send the e-mail approval of the faculty supervisor/ PI. Pedal-operated sanitiser machines exist at the main campus entry, at the entrance of girls' and boys' hostel, mess and canteen, sports block, etc. There is an isolation floor for emergency purposes (students having a report with COVID Positive) inside the hostel building. The health centre has 24X7 nursing assistance available, with medical practitioners general round the clock for any service. Hostellers are not allowed to move outside the campus without approval. The students should wear the mask, maintain social distancing, and wash their hands regularly; posters with directives are placed inside and outside the hostels and near the washrooms. Caretakers/staff must take regular feedback from the students tested Covid-Positive in case of any requirement. Meeting between all the hostellers and Dean of Student Affairs, Chief Warden, Counsellor, Girls Warden, Manager (Student Affairs) is conducted every week to gauge the requirement of hostellers.

Certificate Program in CS Teaching
India has over 10,000 engineering colleges and 100s of degreegranting institutions that focus on engineering. Often the quality of education in many academic institutions is mediocre, primarily due to the background of the faculty. If the quality of education has to improve, teachers in these colleges/universities need to be re-trained through a suitable T3 program.
IIIT-Delhi has designed an online program for CS Teachers to improve teaching. The program will use the talent of experts across the country for enhancing CS teaching in colleges and other institutions. For this, modules on teaching important CS topics have been proposed. These modules will be designed for the teachers who have taught CS a few times. The goal is to improve the teaching capability of the teachers by providing a deeper understanding of concepts and applying concepts for problem-solving. The inclination should be towards developing the capacity to design hands-on assignments for students, sharing possible labs/assignments/projects/lecture slides, providing other valuable resources, etc. The eventual goal, of course, is that this will then improve the teaching of CS to their students.
The program is a collaborative effort among the faculty from reputed institutions. In such an arrangement, the teaching load is distributed, and the best experts from these leading institutions are invited to participate. To facilitate this program, IIIT-Delhi has agreed in principle to offer Certificates (and later Post-Graduate Diploma) to participants who complete one or more modules.

Delhi S&T Cluster
DRIIV (Delhi Research Implementation and Innovation)
The Delhi Science and Technology (S & T) Cluster, managed by DRIIV, was initiated by the Office of the Principal Scientific Advisor (PSA) to the Government of India. Through this kind of endeavor, the S & T Cluster plans to promote advanced knowledge and expertise in S & T for the overall benefit of different cities in India. The idea is also to ensure an effective contribution to Indian R & D to resolve specific national issues. A conglomeration of academia, industry and government bodies will help identify the solutions to society's problems. Delhi Cluster stems from the understanding that virtual and seamless connectivity among academia, R & D laboratories, industries, and government agencies located in the geographic proximity of a particular city, would encourage focused education, research, and innovation. The cluster will provide a broad platform for knowledge exchange amongst human capital from different institutes towards developing better scientific solutions by bringing scientific equipment-intensive labs together with human capital-rich academic institutes.
Under the scheme, IIIT-Delhi is working towards the following causes:

Industry Interactions
IIIT-Delhi | Annual Report 2022-23 62
Industry Interactions
Collaborations between universities and industry have given life to many disruptive discoveries over the years. There are several examples of fruitful partnerships between universities, industry partners, and start-ups. Many ideas from research in universities are relevant for industrial innovations. Others reach the market through licensing or start-up companies. Endeavors to find solutions to complex social, environmental, and economic challenges - for example, in energy, environment, health, or security - have increasingly required collaboration between universities and industry because few organisations have the internal capacity to deliver results
independently.
University-industry collaboration requires careful management and can bring many benefits. These include a two-way flow of ideas: results can flow out to industry, and they can also be in-bound to fuel research questions. For example, sometimes technical problems experienced at the cutting-edge of practice lead to new questions for science.

These committees consist of faculty members, officers, RWA representatives, and students, depending on the nature of the committee. Some of the committees formed recently are the Revenue Generation Committee, the Cost Reduction Committee, the Campus Well-being Committee, the Covid Care Committee, the Committee for Onboarding Policy for Students, and the Committee on Internship and Placement Challenges due to COVID-19.
Student Councils for Departments Student Council for departments are student groups of elected and volunteer students working together with department faculty to provide a means for student expression and assistance in departments' activities, give opportunities for student experience in leadership and encourage student / faculty / community relations.
Innovation and Improvement Initiatives in Education The faculty members at IIIT-Delhi continue to update the curriculum with the emerging trends and implement innovative teaching methods at the Institute. The faculty used Kialo, Media Cloud (developed by researchers at MIT) as well as SNA techniques to demonstrate the point rather than simply lecture on the subject. The resources used varied from documentaries to twitter threads to media reports. The course involved a lot of critical thinking and active engagement from the class even in online mode.

Consultancy Projects
Collaborations between universities and industry have given life to many disruptive discoveries over the years. There are several examples of fruitful partnerships between universities, industry partners, and startups. Many ideas from research in universities are relevant for industrial innovations. Others reach the market through licensing or start-up companies. Endeavors to find solutions to complex social, environmental, and economic challenges - for example, in energy, environment, health, or security - have increasingly required collaboration between universities and industry because few organisations have the internal capacity to deliver results independently.
University-industry collaboration requires careful management and can bring many benefits. These include a two-way flow of ideas: results can flow out to industry, and they can also be in-bound to fuel research questions. For example, sometimes technical problems experienced at the cutting-edge of practice lead to new questions for science.

Consultancy Projects
Collaborations between universities and industry have given life to many disruptive discoveries over the years. There are several examples of fruitful partnerships between universities, industry partners, and start-ups. Many ideas from research in universities are relevant for industrial innovations. Others reach the market through licensing or start-up companies. Endeavors to find solutions to complex social, environmental, and economic challenges - for example, in energy, environment, health, or security - have increasingly required collaboration between universities and industry because few organisations have the internal capacity to deliver results independently.
University-industry collaboration requires careful management and can bring many benefits. These include a two-way flow of ideas: results can flow out to industry, and they can also be in-bound to fuel research questions. For example, sometimes technical problems experienced at the cutting-edge of practice lead to new questions for science.

Quality and Process Improvement Initiatives
The Institute has adopted the practice of forming committees to make decisions. The goal of committee formation is to develop a broadly representative group that is inclusive of and yet diverse on many dimensions, including demographic and disciplinary diversity and the diversity of faculty rank, employment status, or student degree program. The committee members are crucial to accomplishing the goals through their invested engagement in relevant problem-solving.
Formation of Committees for Decision-making
Standing Committees The primary purpose of standing committees at the Institute is to consider and recommend actions and propose policies in the functional areas under their jurisdictions, subject to final approval by the Director. These committees consist of faculty members, officers, RWA representatives, and students, depending on the nature of the committee. Some of the committees formed recently are the Revenue Generation Committee, the Cost Reduction Committee, the Campus Well-being Committee, the Covid Care Committee, the Committee for Onboarding Policy for Students, and the Committee on Internship and Placement Challenges due to COVID-19.
Student Councils for Departments Student Council for departments are student groups of elected and volunteer students working together with department faculty to provide a means for student expression and assistance in departments' activities, give opportunities for student experience in leadership and encourage student / faculty / community relations.
Innovation and Improvement Initiatives in Education The faculty members at IIIT-Delhi continue to update the curriculum with the emerging trends and implement innovative teaching methods at the Institute. The faculty used Kialo, Media Cloud (developed by researchers at MIT) as well as SNA techniques to demonstrate the point rather than simply lecture on the subject. The resources used varied from documentaries to twitter threads to media reports. The course involved a lot of critical thinking and active engagement from the class even in online mode.

Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi Okhla Industrial Estate, Phase III (Near Govind Puri Metro Station) New Delhi, India - 110020

Prof. Pankaj Jalote, Director Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi 10/11/2010
Yearly Report Of Iiit-delhi
22
Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology is a research-led Institute of higher education, with a strong focus on Research and Development. It was created by an Act by Govt of Delhi as a fully empowered State University. Its scope is research and teaching is Information Technology and Allied Areas. It started its BTech (IT) program in 2008, PhD program in 2009, and its MTech program in 2010.
IIIT-Delhi is an autonomous Institute, with its Board (current Chairman: Mr. Kiran Karnik, ex-President, Nasscom) fully empowered to take all important decisions, including starting of academic programs, and intake in the programs. For academic programs, the Board is advised by the Institute's Senate. Hence, for starting any degree program, or enhancing the intake, the Institute is fully empowered and its own internal mechanisms do the due diligence. Though Institute does not require any approval from AICTE or UGC for number of seats, starting of programs, recruitment criteria, etc., UGC has already recognized it as a State University http://www.ugc.ac.in/inside/pub_notice_satatadd.pdf and AICTE has also recognized IIIT-D as an Institute of National Importance as well as a State University http://www.aicte-india.org/einp.htm.
The Institute's Vision statement is: To be a world-class R&D-led institute of higher education in IT and allied areas which is:
Globally respected for research and education
Thriving UG and PG programs
Linked globally, Industry-facing, socially relevant
Being research-led, R&D is the main focus area for the Institute. To enhance R&D, the Institute has been following the approach of building strong Research groups in different areas. That is, when the Institute enters an area, it plans to recruit multiple faculty members in that area to build a strong group. The goal is that any research group started in the Institute should aim to become within the top three groups in the country within three years. As research groups gain strength, they are expected to start specialized MTech programs, while continuing the PhD program.
Within the next two years, as the Institute has developed reasonable strength in the areas of Mobile Computing and Data Management, it plans to start MTech programs in these areas, as well as strengthen and expand its MTech in Information Security. That is, for MTech programs, the objectives are:
Start MTech in Data Management , 2011, intake: 20
Start MTech in Mobile Computing, 2012, intake: 20
Enhance MTech program in Information Security, increase intake to 30
The institute already has a strong PhD program - it was able to attract 7 PhD scholars in 2009 (the first year of its program), and 8 in 2010. Some of these scholars are among the top performers in their UG program. The Institute wants to give a big push to the PhD program, as it believes that while there are many colleges that can offer UG programs very few have the capability of offering strong PhD (and MTech) programs. And it is well recognized that there is an acute shortage of PhDs in the country, which is hurting the R&D efforts as well as academics in India. The Institute has shown that it can attract good faculty, which in turn attract good PhD scholars - this also the Institute has demonstrated. So, another objective for the proposal is:
Rapidly expand the PhD (Computer Science) program, and enhance our collaborative PhD program further

1 Summary This year, for the first time, IIIT-Delhi will have students in each of the four years of the BTech program, and each of the two years of the MTech program. With this year's admissions, our total student strength has now reached 308 UG students, 53 MTech students, and 21 PhD students. To our existing programs (BTech(IT), PhD(CS), and MTech in CS with specialization in Information Security), we added another MTech program - specialization in Data Engineering. It is a unique program - first of its kind in the country. Our faculty strength has increased to 19. We continue to recruit in a highly selective manner, keeping the quality very high - all of our faculty members have PhDs from fine Institutions across the world, most of them having obtained their PhD in the US. Two more candidates, who are currently in the US, have accepted our offer and plan to join in Oct / Nov 2011. Institute's faculty members continue to pursue top quality research. They have published a total of 31 papers, most of them in International journals and conference proceedings. 15 proposals of faculty members have been approved for funding by various agencies for a total R&D project funding commitment of Rs.13,728,424/-. Our faculty has received one best poster award; one PhD Student was selected for the IBM PhD Fellowship, which globally awarded around 70 such fellowships with about 7 in India. One PhD student got the coveted Microsoft PhD Fellowship - only six are given across India. Three PhD students were selected for TCS PhD Fellowship, out of a total of about 20 Fellowships given. IIIT-Delhi organized the first Indo-US teaching-learning workshop at college level in its premises. The workshop was funded by Indo-US S&T foundation and was attended by about 8 delegates from US and about 30 delegates from India. A few other workshops and symposia were organized by the Institute. While no placements have taken place as the first batch is yet to graduate, many 3rd year students and MTech students got high quality internships in India and abroad. A total of 40 got internships, of which 22 were in private companies in India, 12 were abroad, and 6 in government and other sectors. IIIT-Delhi organized full selection committee meetings in the US in April 2011. This is perhaps the first time in recent past that an academic Institution from India is holding selection committee meeting in US, where the largest number of Indians graduates with PhDs in Computer Science every year. Out of the offers made, one candidate has accepted the offer. The construction of permanent campus is reaching the final stages. After some delays, the current schedule is that the academic buildings will be operational in January 2012,
18
while faculty residences, some of the hostels, and some other buildings will be ready by June 2012. Overall, the Institute continues to do well with good quality faculty and students, and strong UG and PG programs. However, much more remains to be done to reach closer to our vision of becoming a globally respected institution.

Photographer anonymity technology: Shishir Nagaraja: Developed to protect whistleblowers, journalists, dissidents, and law-enforcement personnel (Project sponsored by Google faculty grant 2. Network security tool: Shishir Nagaraja: developed for DRDO for resisting botnet attacks on enterprise networks and small-business; it incorporates a new statistical algorithm based on non-linear dimensionality reduction. 3. Privacy-preserving traffic analysis on the cloud: Shishir Nagaraj: developed for IBM project - traffic analysis to detect attacks and intrusions is often time consuming. This technology helps multiple ISPs to collaborate on detecting attacks in a privacy preserving way whilst also leveraging the cloud technology to keep costs down and address privacy requirements of the ISPs themselves. (linked to IBM project below and P3CA paper above) 4. CVDMagic Application: Pushpendra Singh, Amarjeet Singh, and Vinayak Naik: Developed a CVDMagic application for early detection of Cardio-Vascular Disease based on previously proposed studies using non-laboratory based tests. The application was developed within the Sana Framework (developed by Sana group at MIT - http://www.sanamobile.org) and deployed in rural areas of Punjab with Electronic Health Point (EHP) who are setting up rural clinics in that state. The healthcare worker from EHP collected data for about 190 people using the application and we are in the process of analyzing the collected data and working on a paper for ICTD 2012 5. Disha Journey Planner: Pushpendra Singh, Amarjeet Singh, and Vinayak Naik: Developed as an internship project and later on modified to include extensive database from the industrial partner - DIMTS, this application provides the user with route information for going between any two places in Delhi using public transport. The application is currently hosted and maintained by our industrial partner - Delhi Integrated Multi-modal Transportation Systems (DIMTS) 6. Right Fare: Pushpendra Singh, Amarjeet Singh, and Vinayak Naik: Developed as an internship project, the application takes two locations in Delhi as input over SMS and calculates the approximate auto fare between the two given locations. The application also returns the list of landmarks that will come on the way. The service is supposed to help people knowing the shortest possible route between any two locations and avoid being overcharged. Our industrial collaborator, a startup called Ideophone. (The name by Ideophone is changed to Autofare
http://www.ideophone.in/products/sms/) has now further extended the service with some additional features including support for multiple cities by. 7. IVR system: Amarjeet Singh: Implementation of for Institute's admission process. As logs suggests, it has been used by hundreds of applicants.

New Campus under Phase I Construction The transit campus is under tremendous pressure and is to be shifted to the new Campus by Dec2011. The new campus for the IIIT-D is coming up as the extension of the GB Pant Polytechnic at Okhla Phase III New Delhi on a plot of 25 acres of the 65acres plot of the Polytechnic earmarked for the purpose. The sprawling state of the art campus that is spread out over entire land over the sloppy terrain and buildings developed contoured to the topography of the land to be constructed in three phases. The Phase I consist of the following: Academic lecture hall block R& D block, Resource Centre cum Library building Dining block Boys Hostel Girls hostel Dining block Faulty Residential building Service blocks STP The entire area is divided into mutually interactive yet separate zones namely the residential areas for faculty, academic areas and the student residential areas connected by connecting pathways with vehicular entry restricted to the peripheries only.
36
There is a single G +11 storied faculty residential block with 27 apartments and 3 guest rooms in the residential zone. The academic zone comprise of separate blocks for the resource centre cum library in G + 3 storied block, the G+2 Lecture hall block, and the G + 5 storied Research & Development block which would house the research labs, faculty seating, administrative and academic heads with their supporting staff. The student residential zone comprises of separate blocks for the the boys hostel G+7with 350seats and girls hostel G+4 for 150 seats approx. and a G +3 dining block with cafeteria and mess, student activity areas. All the above areas excepting for the faculty residences will be served by the district cooling air-conditioning system to be cooled on selective basis during day /night /peak demand settings, housed in the service block. Use of VFD controlled systems, temperature based sensors with BMS controls will run air-conditioning efficiently. Moreover the building envelopes are being made efficient to insulate from heat using dry cladding in external finishes and AAC blocks in place of regular brickwork in masonry. Use of natural material and minimum use of high energy consuming materials are basic ingredients of the project aim towards green building certification. The electrical system would be provided with a partial load backup from 2x500kva DG sets. The entire waste water generated in the campus would be recycled using 2x65 kld STP and water so generated will be used for horticulture, flushing and air-conditioning works. The entire areas will be protected by fire alarm and fighting equipments as wet risers/sprinklers and smoke management systems. The telephony and networking will be on a backbone of OFC cabling with redundancy using loop and star configurations. The entire rock excavated from the areas will be broken down and utilized in external development works. Utilization of energy saving lighting systems, use of non conventional energy through solar hot water systems with PNG backup and will reduce power consumption considerably. The works of construction are in full swing and all packages for same are likely to be commissioned for Academic zone and part students hostels and dining areas by NovDecember 2011 for partial occupation and faculty residences by Mar2012 with all works completed by June2012.

Overview
Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (aka. IIIT-Delhi or IIIT-D) was created as a State University by an act of Delhi Government (The IIIT Delhi Act, 2007) empowering it to do research and development and grant degrees. IIIT-Delhi was officially established on 10th June, 2008. First class (for B.Tech. (CSE) students) was held on 8th September, 2008.
The institute began with its first batch of 60 B.Tech students in 2008. Since then, it has come a long way with nearly 28 faculties specializing in diverse areas of Computer Science and Electronics & Communications Engineering, and nearly 420 students consisting of 4 batches of B.Tech., 2 batches of M.Tech. and 4 batches of Ph.D. In a relatively short time, it has earned a good reputation in India and abroad for being a center of quality education and research in IT and allied areas. AICTE has recognized us as an Institute of National Importance, along with other IIITs.
Campus
This year, for the first time, IIIT-Delhi has started its operations from its main campus at Okhla in all programs. With this year's admissions, our total student strength has now reached 430 UG students, 115 M.Tech. students, and 39 Ph.D. students.
The construction of permanent campus is reaching the final stages. After delays, the the academic buildings were partially handed over in Aug, where currently our classes are being held. Only one hostel has been handed over. The rest of the campus is likely to be handed over by the end of the year. Infrastructure
The entire campus is connected via 100 mbps switched network and 100 Mbps wi-fi. Internet is provided by two leased lines, provided and NIC and MTNL, and 24x7 access to internet is allowed on campus. There are about 100 computers in the general labs, all of which are dual boot systems with Windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux. The advanced M.Tech. labs are equipped with state-of-the art software and tools such as MATLAB, Cadence Suite, Spice Tools etc. The research labs and faculty offices are equipped with printers and CD/DVD-writers. Other than these, there are 5 network printers, including one color printer. Scanning facility is also available. All computers are protected by a central UPS system. Current degree programs

Annual Report \ 2011-12 \ 6
To our existing programs B.Tech. (CSE), M.Tech. (CSE), and Ph.D. (CSE), we have also added B.Tech., M.Tech., and Ph.D. in ECE. We have added an M.Tech. specialization in Mobile Computing (within CSE, in which we already have specializations in Information Security and Data Engineering) and started with M.Tech. (VLSI and Embedded Systems) within the ECE.
Faculty Our faculty strength has increased to 28. We continue to recruit in a highly selective manner, keeping the quality very high - all of our faculty members have PhDs from fine Institutions across the world, most of them having obtained their Ph.D. in the US. We continue to organize selection committees frequently to respond swiftly to applications, and also held two selection committee meetings in the US in April 2012 - perhaps the only leading Institute in India to take this route.
Research funding
Institute's faculty members continue to pursue top quality research. They have published a total of 40 papers, most of them in International journals and conference proceedings. Overall 23 proposals of faculty members have been approved for funding by various agencies for a combined R&D project funding commitment of 2.77 crores rupees.
Awards
Our faculty and Ph.D. students have received various awards: IBM Faculty Award 2011-12; three best poster award and best paper awards; one IBM Ph.D. Fellowship (which globally awarded around 70 such fellowships with about 7 in India), three TCS Research Fellowship Awards, and one IJCB Doctoral Consortium Fellowship 2011.
Placements
For the first time placements took place as the first batch graduated in 2012. We focused on high end companies and with great difficulty convinced some of them to visit us - almost all the companies that came recruited some candidates and were generally happy with the talent they saw. Overall, the average compensation is over Rs 7 Lac/yr, with about 10 students getting offers of more than Rs 10 Lac/yr.
Annual Report \ 2011-12 \ 7
Overall, the Institute continues to do well with good quality faculty and students, and strong UG and PG programs. However, much more remains to be done to reach closer to our vision of becoming a globally respected institution.

15. MIOSphere: Monitoring Information in the Online Social Media Sphere. MIOSphere is a system to collect, analyze and visualize the diffusion of information in popular Online Social Media services. Our main objective is to build a rich, updated, and representative data set containing several types of information that users are sharing in Online Social Media services. We plan to include using MIOSphere technology to provide data for other scientific projects and for Web applications which might help users to manage and analyze information diffused in the Online Social Media Sphere.
16. ChaMAILeon: Simplified email sharing like never before!While passwords, by definition, are meant to be secret, recent trends in the Internet usage have witnessed an increasing number of people sharing their email passwords for both personal and professional purposes. As sharing passwords increases the chances of your passwords being compromised, leading websites like Google strongly advise their users not to share their passwords with anyone. To cater to this conflict of usability versus security and privacy, we introduce ChaMAILeon, an experimental service, which allows users to share their email passwords while maintaining their privacy and not compromising their security. ChaMAILeon provides users with a unique capability to define access control on their emails. Now you can control who can see which emails and who can send emails to whom from your account, by having multiple passwords for your email.
17. PhishAri: Detecting Phishing in Twitter. PhishAri is a Chrome browser extension for Twitter which detects phishing tweets in real time. PhishAri provides a clean, easy to use interface to display phishing tweets on your Twitter timeline. PhishAri makes realtime decisions to save you from risky clicks on those Phish URLs. No link previews, no browser warning pages but instant, realtime indications. PhishAri will show a legitimate or phish indicator (next to the URL) for tweets with URLs. Phishing URLs will have a red indicator, warning users not to click on the same. The legitimate links on other hand will have a green indicator. One can download PhishAri (beta version) from the Chrome Web store.
18. SMSAssassin: Detecting SMS Spams using Crowd Sourcing Approach. Due to exponential increase in use of Short Message Service (SMS) over mobile phones in developing countries, there has been a burst of
Annual Report \ 2011-12 \ 14
spam SMSes. The main goal for this research is to build algorithms and solutions to reduce the SMS spams in developing nations like India. We use crowd-sourcing approach, apply machine learning techniques and keep the user preferences in our solutions. We are currently evaluating the effectiveness of the system in real-world among some volunteers (thanks for their time and efforts!)

Infrastructure and Facilities
9.1 Campus Facilities The IIIT (Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology )-Delhi Act, 2007 endowed the establishment and incorporation of a non affiliating and teaching Institute at Delhi to facilitate and promote studies, research, incubation and extension work in Information Technology and its application domains, and also to achieve excellence in these and connected fields.
With the above objectives in view, the Government of NCT of Delhi allocated 25 acres of land in the GB Pant Polytechnic Campus to enable the setting up of its Campus located behind the Phase III Okhla Industrial Estate at a distance if 1 ½ K.M. (approx.) from Okhla railway station, South Delhi
New Campus under Phase I Construction
The transit campus is under tremendous pressure and is to be shifted to the new Campus by Dec 2011. The new campus for the IIIT-D is coming up as the extension of the GB Pant Polytechnic at Okhla Phase III New Delhi on a plot of 25 acres of the 65acres plot of the Polytechnic earmarked for the purpose.
The sprawling state of the art campus that is spread out over entire land over the sloppy terrain and buildings developed contoured to the topography of the land to be constructed in three phases.
The Phase I consist of the following:
Academic lecture hall block R & D block, Resource Centre cum Library building Dining Block Boys Hostel Girls Hostel Faulty Residential building Service Blocks STP
The entire area is divided into mutually interactive yet separate zones namely the residential areas for faculty, academic areas and the student residential areas connected by connecting pathways with vehicular entry

Annual Report \ 2011-12 \ 46
restricted to the peripheries only.
There is a single G +11 storied faculty residential block with 27 apartments and 3 guest rooms in the residential zone.
The academic zone comprise of separate blocks for the resource centre cum library in G + 3 storied block, the G+2 Lecture hall block, and the G + 5 storied Research & Development block which would house the research labs, faculty seating, administrative and academic heads with their supporting staff.
The student residential zone comprises of separate blocks for the boys hostel G+7with 350seats and girls hostel G+4 for 150 seats approx. and a G +3 dining block with cafeteria and mess, student activity areas.
All the above areas excepting for the faculty residences will be served by the district cooling air-conditioning system to be cooled on selective basis during day /night /peak demand settings, housed in the service block. Use of VFD controlled systems, temperature based sensors with BMS controls will run air-conditioning efficiently. Moreover the building envelopes are being made efficient to insulate from heat using dry cladding in external finishes and AAC blocks in place of regular brickwork in masonry.
Use of natural material and minimum use of high energy consuming materials are basic ingredients of the project aim towards green building certification.
The electrical system would be provided with a partial load backup from 2x500kva DG sets.
The entire waste water generated in the campus would be recycled using 2x65 kld STP and water so generated will be used for horticulture, flushing and air-conditioning works.
The entire areas will be protected by fire alarm and fighting equipments as wet risers/sprinklers and smoke management systems.
The telephony and networking will be on a backbone of OFC cabling with redundancy using loop and star configurations.
The entire rock excavated from the areas will be broken down and utilized in external development works. Utilization of energy saving lighting systems, use of non conventional energy through solar hot water systems with PNG backup and will reduce power consumption considerably.
Annual Report \ 2011-12 \ 47
The works of construction are in full swing and all packages for same are likely to be commissioned for Academic zone and part students hostels and dining areas by Nov-December 2011 for partial occupation and faculty residences by Mar2012 with all works completed by June2012.

9 Infrastructure and Facilities 9.1 Campus Facilities
The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology established by Delhi Act, 2007 endowed the establishment and incorporation of a non-affiliating and teaching institute at Delhi to facilitate and promote studies, research, incubation and extension work in Information Technology and its application domains, and also to achieve excellence in these and connected fields.
With the above objectives in view, the Government of NCT of Delhi allocated 25 acres of land in the GB Pant Polytechnic Campus to enable the setting up of the IIIT-D permanent campus, which is located behind the Phase III Okhla Industrial Estate at a distance if 1 ½ km (approx.) from the Okhla railway station, South Delhi.
Phase I Construction
The new campus for the IIIT-D, which started its operations from its transit campus at NSIT Dwarka New Delhi, finally came up in Okhla Phase III New Delhi on a plot of 25 acres out of the 65-acre plot of the GB Pant Polytechnic earmarked for the purpose. The IIIT-D started its operations from the new campus from academic session starting July 2012.
The sprawling state of the art campus that is spread out over entire land over the sloppy terrain and buildings developed contoured to the topography of the land was planned to be constructed in three phases.
The Phase I of the Campus with a covered area of 32,500 sqm consists of the following facilities that have been put to use :
 Academic R & D block
 lecture hall block
 Library cum Information Centre building
 Dining Block
 Boys Hostel
 Girls Hostel
 Faculty Residences
 Service Block
 2 Nos STP
 Guard rooms
 The entire area is divided into mutually interactive yet separate zones namely the residential areas for faculty, academic areas and the student residential areas connected by connecting pathways with vehicular entry restricted to the peripheries only.
 There is a single G +11 storied faculty residential block with 27 apartments and 1 guest house flat, 1 community event flat and 2 small visiting faculty flats and terrace garden and stilted parking in the residential zone. There are intermittent sprawling greens between the buildings.
49
 The academic zone comprises separate blocks for Library cum Information Centre in G+3 storied block, the G+2 Lecture hall block, and the G + 5 storied Research & Development block which houses the research labs, faculty seating, administrative and academic heads with their supporting staff.
 The student residential zone comprises separate blocks for the boys hostel G+7 with 350seats and girls hostel G+4 with 150 seats, and a G +3 Dining block with cafeteria and mess, student activity areas, a fully equipped gymnasium , music and art rooms .
 All the above areas except the faculty residences are served by the district cooling air-conditioning system cooled on selective basis during day/night /peak demand settings, housed in the service block. Use of VFD/VAV controlled systems, heat recovery wheel, temperature-based sensors with BMS controls run air-conditioning efficiently.
 Moreover, the building envelopes are made efficient to insulate from heat using dry cladding in external finishes and Double unit toughened glass of specified thermal resistivity and transmission values in academic areas and AAC blocks in place of regular brickwork in masonry in residential areas and hostels. Use of natural material and minimum use of high energy consuming materials are basic ingredients of the project aimed towards a green building.
 The electrical system on 11KVA supply is provided with a partial load backup from 2x500kva DG sets.
 The entire waste water generated in the campus is recycled using 2x65 kld STP and water so generated will be used for horticulture, flushing and air-conditioning works. The solid waste management is carried out through an NGO for ensuring proper disposal. The rain water is harvested in rain water harvesting pits and shales .
 The entire areas will be protected by fire alarm and fighting equipment as wet risers/sprinklers and latest smoke management systems.
 The telephony and networking is on a backbone of OFC cabling with redundancy using loop and star configurations.
 The entire rock excavated from the areas is broken down and mostly utilized in external development works. Utilization of energy saving lighting systems as CFLs and T5 fixtures, use of non-conventional energy through solar hot water systems with PNG backup reduces power consumption considerably.
 The sports arena has well-lit basket ball court with 5layers synthetic coating, 2nos concrete courts for tennis. Separate courts for badminton for boys and girls hostels, multipurpose sports field, volley ball courts and running tracks would operational shortly.
 The works of construction completed and commissioned for Academic zone and part of students hostels and dining areas were completed in July 2012 for partial occupation and faculty residences and boys' hostel by March 2013 .
50
 The current campus can provide accommodation to about 500 students and 23 faculty members. Its office space is adequate to house 48 faculty members. The lecture hall and lab space can accommodate up to 1000 students.
 The present campus is maintained by dedicated teams for Facility Management and Security operations.
Phase II Construction
The proposal for Phase-II for construction of another 60000 sqm to cater to 2500 students and 125 faculty has also been taken up with the Department of Training and Technical Education, Delhi Government.

1) Executive Summary Since its creation in 2008 through an act of Delhi Government empowering it to do research and grant degrees, in six short years IIIT-Delhi has come a long way. We currently have over 1000 students in our B.Tech, M.Tech, and PhD programs, and continue to attract and retain high quality faculty - the single biggest challenge in academia in India. Our regular faculty strength has now crossed 40, all holding PhDs from prestigious institutions from across the world, mostly from US and Europe. Research remains the key focus of the institute. Our faculty members and students have published over 100 papers in international journals and conference proceedings this year alone. Some of the papers have been acclaimed and have received Best Paper and Poster awards in prestigious National and International conferences. Many of our PhD students have been selected for prestigious research grants and fellowships such as the Prime Minister's Fellowship, IBM Fellowship, and TCS Fellowship. Four of our young faculty members are the proud recipients of the DST's Inspire fellowship, while another one has been honored with Adobe's Excellence in Research Award. This year 17 research proposals from our faculty were approved for funding by various agencies for a total commitment of over Rs. 3 crores. In our R&D efforts, we remain committed to developing technologies that can be transferred for commercial exploitation or use by other organizations. This year over two dozen tools and technologies were transferred to over ten organizations. Three start-ups based on technologies and tools developed at IIIT-Delhi have emerged - one in the area of energy management, one in education, and one in social networking. This year we also achieved a major milestone. We awarded our first two PhDs to Kuldeep and Himanshu Bhatt, thus graduating students in all three higher education degrees - Bachelor's, Master's and Doctorate in a short span of six years. Both received good reviews for their thesis, from the examiners who include some international experts. During the PhD, Kuldeep was awarded the prestigious Microsoft PhD fellowship, which is given to only five students every year in India, and Himanshu received the coveted IBM PhD fellowship. Both are now working in Xerox research. To consolidate our research and make a stronger impact in targeted areas, our vision is to start research centers in focused areas. In January 2014, we opened our first Centre of Excellence in cyber security, aimed at imparting high-level education, technical training and research in this critical area which will help various stakeholders like the government, industry and general public. The center was inaugurated in January by Dr Gulshan Rai, Director General of CERT-In (Computer Emergency Response Team-India). Cyberspace management and cybersecurity have been identified by the PM as key emerging issues and core areas of focus. IIIT-D remains committed to engaging with science also as a problem solver and as a social good. While our faculty members collaborate with colleagues across the world, we have also initiated some formal international collaborations. We have started a joint PhD program with Australia's Queensland University of Technology (QUT), signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) to facilitate academic collaboration between the two institutions, and inked a pact with the Graduate School of
4
Information Security (GSIS), Korea University, Seoul for joint projects, joint supervision of doctoral students, organizing joint academic and scientific activities etc. Key Highlights (Infrastructure) :
 Phase I of the permanent campus of IIIT-D became operational in August 2012, with
over 30,000 sqm of space, sufficient for about 1000 students and 50 faculty members.
 The proposal for Phase-II of the construction has been approved by the Delhi
government, which will add another 60,000 sqm of building space to cater to a total of 2,500 students and 125 faculty members.
We continue to focus on effective resource utilization and have installed smart electricity meters which show energy usage in a dashboard. Other measures are also been taken for more efficient use of energy and water resources. Solar panels have been installed which help us in integrating renewable sources of energy to fulfill the energy requirements of the institute. After the successful placement of the first two batches, the batch which has just graduated continued the tradition of a strong performance in placement. In a short span, and despite being a young institutive the university is proud to attract companies like Google, Microsoft, Xerox Research, Amazon, Adobe, EMC, etc. Some other international companies have also recruited from IIIT-Delhi. By most measures for placement- highest domestic salary offered, the highest overseas package offered, percentage of students placed, mean and median offers - we compare favourably with the top institutions in the country. Almost 10% of the graduating BTech batch got fellowships for higher studies in top institutions in the world - a very fine record. Overall, we have had a very good year, and are well on our path of becoming a globally respected and recognised institute. Though many challenges remain, we are confident of addressing them in the coming years with the support of students, faculty, administration, and other well wishers.

2.7 Infrastructure
Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology was set up by an act of the Delhi government, 2007. It endowed the establishment and incorporation of a non-affiliating and teaching institute in Delhi to facilitate and promote studies, research, incubation and extension work in Information Technology and its application domains, and also to achieve excellence in these and connected fields. With the above objectives in view, the Government of NCT of Delhi allocated 25 acres of land in the GB Pant Polytechnic Campus to enable the setting up of the IIIT-D permanent campus, which is located behind the Govindpuri Metro station in Phase III of the Okhla Industrial Estate. Way Forward: Phase II Construction The IIIT-D campus that is spread out over the sloppy terrain in Okhla phase-III has been planned to be constructed in three phases. The proposal for Phase-II for construction of another 60,000 sqm of building space to cater to the requirements of 2,500 students and 125 faculty members has received the approval of the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. The Architects have been appointed for the purpose and plans submitted to local authorities for approval. The Project Management Consultants are also being hired, and the on-site construction would commence soon after we get all the clearances. The construction of the core academic area is expected to be completed and put to use in the academic session of 2016. Earlier, the first phase of the construction covered an area of 32,500 sq m consisting of an Academic R & D block, a lecture hall block, a Library-cum-Information Centre building, a Dining Block, a Boys Hostel, a Girls Hostel, Faculty Residences, Service Block, 2 STPs and guard rooms.

4.5 Incubation & Start Ups
Research and collaborative work at IIIT Delhi has resulted in four start ups; which are all currently at early stages. Three student ventures have gone or about to go commercial. The IIIT-D recognizes this as an opportunity to support innovation and social & technological entrepreneurship and is therefore working towards providing incubation facility. The three ventures are:
 Wiziters (anonymous social network): has attracted private investment but is not
looking at incubation.
 Backpack (course management): wants to run out of campus - is close to
commercialization.
 In-gage (in-store customer feedback & analytics): may be interested in incubation
facility; has got 2 paying customers.
It is therefore proposed to set up a facility for student and/or faculty ventures now with institute resources and simultaneously initiate a tie up with DST and DEITY for support.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Our faculty strength is about 40, all of whom hold PhDs from prestigious institutions from across the world. We also have about 10 visiting faculty, who augment our regular faculty and also provide the much needed diversity of courses.
Research remains the key focus of the institute. Our faculty members and students have published over 175 papers in international journals and conference proceedings last year. Two of these papers have won the best paper awards in International Conferences, and four have received the Best Poster award. Our team of eight faculty members and twenty students are one of the winners of the Mahindra Driverless Car Challenge. Another team won the Indo-US Grant Challenge for an affordable
blood pressure monitor. One faculty member received the DST's Inspire fellowship, taking the total number of faculty with this Fellowship to six.
About 20 faculty members are involved in collaborations with over 60 external collaborators from across the world. Of these, about 10 are with industry, 15 with academics in India, and about 35 with overseas scientists.
This year 15 research proposals from our faculty were approved for funding by various agencies for a total commitment of over Rs. 4 crore. Seven of our PhD students have been selected for the TCS PhD Fellowship, taking the total number of these fellowships to 27 - probably the highest in the country. We also received 9
Since its creation in 2008, IIIT-Delhi has come a long way in a short span of seven years. With this year's admissions, our student strength is over 1100 with about 800 BTech, 200 MTech, and 100 PhD students. In the 3rd Convocation, we conferred 2 Ph.D, 81 B.Tech, 2 Dual and 61 M.Tech degrees
PhD Fellowships under the Vishvesvarya PhD scheme.
We continue with our plan to start research centres in focused areas. This summer, we started our second Research Centre in Computational Biology, which was inaugurated by the DBT secretary, Prof. K. Vijay Raghavan. We have also launched an MTech program in Computational Biology and have entered in an MOU with IGIB for collaboration for research and the MTech program.
In our R&D efforts, we remain committed to developing technologies that can be transferred for commercial exploitation or use by other organizations. This year, over two dozen new technologies and tools were developed which were transferred to various organisations. Five start-ups based on technologies and tools developed at IIIT-Delhi have emerged so far.
To further innovation and entrepreneurship, the Institute has also started an Incubation Centre that
2
was formally inaugurated on 6th April 2015 by Mr. R. Chandrashekar, President of NASSCOM.
We earlier had received the UGC 12B accreditation, and this year the Institute also got NAAC accreditation at the A level, the highest given.
Due to our rapid growth, the current campus is already fully utilized with little scope to grow further. In fact, our student intake is now restricted due to space constraints, and we have slowed on our faculty recruitment for the same reason. For further growth, construction for the phaseII of the campus has already started. This will add another 64,000 sq. meters of building space, approximately two times the current area, which will increase our capacity for faculty and students to three times the current capacity.
In our campus, we continue to focus on effective resource utilization and have installed smart electricity meters which show energy usage in a dashboard. Last year,
we installed solar panels of 40KW capacity, which generate about 4K units of power every month. While our cost savings are small, this helps us contribute to the environment, and also reduce our energy requirement from the grid, making it available for other uses.
With respect to placements, this year again we kept up with our previous years' strong performance with placement in top companies like Microsoft, Xerox Research, Amazon, Adobe, EMC, etc. By most measures for placement- highest domestic salary offered, percentage of students placed, mean and median offers - we are probably amongst the top few in our peer group. Overall, we have had a very good year and are well on our path to becoming a globally respected and recognised institute. Though many challenges remain, we are confident of addressing them in the coming years with the support of students, faculty, administration, and other well-wishers.

OUR MISSION & VISION
7
The Institute's permanent campus in Okhla became operational in August 2012, before which it was functioning from NSIT, Dwarka. The Institute currently has a builtup area of about 32000 sq. meters including lecture halls, class rooms, research labs, instruction labs, Boys' hostel, Girls' hostel, dining and student center, space for student clubs, etc. It also has a general purpose playing field, tennis courts, basketball court, volleyball court, etc.
With energy conservation at its core, smart electricity meters have been installed at the buildings in the campus to study the power consumption pattern for effective energy management and efficient utilization of electricity. . It has two functioning STPs through which the Institute recycles all its waste water and uses it for irrigation.
The Institute has a campus-wide computer network with a redundant 10 gigabit fibre backbone, 1 Gbps Internet connectivity, and LAN or Wi-Fi access throughout the campus including hostels, classrooms, and residences. All classrooms here are equipped with multimedia capability including projectors and audio systems.
The Library and Information Center of the Institute has books in various disciplines, and subscribes to many major Digital Libraries including ACM, Elsevier, IEEE, Springer, etc. It also subscribes to tools like Ephorus, IThenticate, Turnitin. It supports inter library loan and document delivery service, and has many Kindle readers which students can take on loan for accessing online e-books and other e-resources. Construction of Phase II of the campus has already started. This construction will add another 64000 sq. meters built up area including seminar block, research labs, faculty rooms, faculty residence, student hostels, and a sports complex. The construction is likely to take two years.

STUDENT ACTIVITY

At IIITD, a major chunk of students' time goes in academics as it requires hardwork and focused effort. Nonetheless, there are many facilities and clubs to grow in various ways. Students take part in a number of social and cultural activities. If they want to pursue a hobby, they just need to find some like-minded people to start their own club. These clubs not only hone their leadership skills but also help instill team spirit in them. Several student clubs in the institute enable them to enhance their talent in areas beyond academics. Clubs already in existence at IIIT Delhi are Quiz Club - Trivialis, Design Club - Ink, Dance Club - MadToes, Music Club - Audio Bytes-, Photography Club - Tasveer, the Literary Club, Eco Club and Adventure Club. These clubs enable students to come together, share knowledge and mentor those looking to break into the field. Students can also suggest books for the library, organize a blood donation campaign, an adventure trip during summer holidays or purchase a new instrument for the music room.
Students are also encouraged to help the society in some way or the other. Almost every student is involved with various NGOs all over the country. The institute also has its own home-grown NGO of students called ‘FindAWay', which helps the children in need. Summary report of student's clubs activities for 2014-15 is placed as Appendix G.

APPENDIX B Technologies Developed/ Deployed at IIIT-Delhi in 2014-15
1. Robust, low power sensors to monitor snow petrels in collaboration with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun. Sensors have been successfully deployed in the Antarctica from January till April 2015. The system is able to measure the nest temperatures and to detect the presence of the parent birds in the nest. Presence detection has been achieved by using light dependent resistors due to the fact that motion detectors based on infrared radiation do not work with these fast moving and well insulated birds. An ordinary and inexpensive 9V battery is able to power the system for approximately 2 weeks at temperatures ranging from -30°C to -5°C. 2. Swarath is our entry into the autonomous car competition by Mahindra. After successfully passing through the initial selection stages, we are competing with another 11 teams heading to the live demo stage in which we have to implement and proof our concepts developed so far. This concept involves the usage of comparatively low cost sensors and concentrates on the algorithms for vision, perception, etc. to achieve a driver less car. 3. Nari Raksha project: In this project an accessory needs to be developed allowing women in need or in dangerous situations to contact relatives to ask for help.

A Computational Tool (combining kinetic Monte Carlo model and data analysis) is being developed that can be potentially applied to find optimal strategies in cancer therapy (such as by selective induction of apoptotic death in cancer cells). Such an approach may also have broader applicability (in the context of Diseases and therapy). Kinetic Monte Carlo is astochastic simulation method that can capture the essential dynamics of biological systems, both inherent and extrinsic variability and stochastic bifurcations of any type (impact of D bifurcations, P bifurcations, bifurcations of purely stochastic kinetic origin etc.). The data analysis involves statistical methodologies and a quantitative scoring technique (similar to bio--‐informatic scoring approaches). Initial feasibility has been demonstrated by an in silico study of selective killing of cancer cells under TRAIL (death ligand) therapy.

27. AirZen: AirZen is a compact, real-time pollution measurement device developed at IIITD under Jyoti Sinha that aims at not only tracking the pollution levels of the major gas pollutants but the particulate matter including PM 2.5 and PM 10. This project aims to empower citizens of Delhi and other big polluted metropolitan cities with a real time pollution tracking data and to help them take decisions about car/ walking routes with minimum pollution, safe school zones for children, advisory to home buyers as well as advisory precautions and medicines in case of individual pollutant levels crossing the minimum threshold. AirZen won the best "Entrepreneurship project" under the ESYA ENT competition which started with more than 25 teams. 28. All-In-One Women, Child, home and vehicle safety device: State of the art solutions for child, home, vehicle and women safety require you to purchase the devices and apps separately. Under guidance of Jyoti Sinha, a team of IIITD students have developed a low cost all-in-one safety prototype that can act for all four safety paradigm and cost less than one-fourth of the price of all devices. The device uses interchangeable and simultaneously running modes with a smart app to navigate between the modes easily. This compact, revolutionary design was awarded the "most popular prototype" in national level ST Microelectronics University Design Championship where more than 700 participated.

Executive Summary
With the fifth graduating batch, this is a historic and proud moment for IIIT-Delhi. We have continued to provide high-quality education, promote research and entrepreneurship advancements, and build programmes to help the sections of society. Faculty, students, alumni, and staff are assiduously working hard to make IIITDelhi a top tier institution in India.
"Education is a journey, not a destination" - a famous and enduring quote which is the core of IIIT-Delhi. With this year's admission, IIIT-Delhi strives to facilitate a delightful journey to over 1137 students, including 781 BTech, 230 MTech, and 126 PhD students. In the 4th Convocation, we conferred 4 PhD, 109 B.Tech, 4 Dual and 102 M.Tech degrees.
The backbone of IIIT-Delhi is its faculty, current strength is 39, all of whom hold PhD degrees from prestigious institutions from across the world. In addition, we have 9 visiting faculty, who augment our regular faculty. With the help of our faculty, cutting-edge curriculum, teaching innovations, and diversity of courses, we help the students to attain world class education at the institute.
We have also introduced a 3rd UG programme after CSE and ECE, "BTech programme in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics (CSAM)". The program aims to produce graduates with computational skills as well as the ability to use sophisticated mathematical concepts and tools in order to approach problems.
In pursuing our goal of becoming top tier institution, research is the main emphasis. Faculty and research scholars are engaged in innovative research on forefront technologies. Last year, 152 research papers are published, including 24 journal papers, 117 conference papers, 11 workshop papers, and 7 book/ book chapters. Our faculty was invited to more than 102 national and international seminars as speaker or guest. Like previous years, this year too our faculty continues to receive several awards including best paper award in conferences, NVIDIA Innovation Award, and the prestigious DeitY young faculty fellowship. Moreover, this year 16 research proposals from our faculty were approved for funding by various agencies for a total commitment of Rs. 4.7 crores.
In the current ecosystem, collaboration is the key to success in research and innovation. Our faculty members were involved in collaborations with 62 external collaborators, across the world. Of these, 15 are with industry, 35 with universities and/or faculty from other universities and 12 are with research labs.
Within seven years of our PhD programme, we crossed a figure of 100 PhD students who have continued to excel in research and published their research papers in prestigious conference and journals, jointly with their thesis advisors and collaborators. Our PhD students have also received several prestigious fellowships: 1 TCS PhD Fellowship, 14 Visvesvaraya PhD Fellowships, 1 UGC Fellowship, and 12 Institute scholarships.
Another milestone we have attained is the establishment of Infosys Center for Artificial Intelligence (CAI). Infosys Foundation has given IIIT-Delhi a multi-million dollar grant to establish the center and it was inaugurated by Mr. Pravin Rao, Chief Operating Officer of Infosys on April 4, 2016. This is one of the largest industry-supported research centers in an academic institution in the country. Through this grant, IIIT-Delhi has been given the responsibility of conducting breakthrough research in the field of Artificial Intelligence Technology.
In our R&D efforts, we remain committed to entrepreneurial advancements and developing technologies that can be transferred for commercial implementation or use by other organizations. This year, 10 new technologies and tools were developed which were transferred to various organisations. Five start-ups based on technologies and tools developed at IIIT-Delhi have emerged so far.
With the success of the brand ambassadors, the alumni, IIIT-Delhi is poised to become one of the most sought institutions in India. Many of our alumni are running their own companies or start-ups, contributing in established companies and research labs, or pursuing higher education in reputed institutions across the globe. There are good signs of building a strong and committed alumni network which can significantly contribute to the growth of the institute.
IIIT-Delhi's Library and Information Center has initiated a project to host a collection of books on computing written by India-based authors since the start of Computer Science education in India in the 1960s. The collection can become a unique resource for researchers working on the history of computing education in
3
India. Right now we have 100 titles in the collection and counting. The current collection can be seen at the library portal as well.
This year, we have received NBA accreditation for our B.Tech (CSE) programme valid for 5 years. Earlier, we had received the UGC 12B and NAAC ‘A' Level accreditations. The Institute has also received funding of Rs 1.5 Crores from Delhi Government as per its incubation policy to promote entrepreneurship in the Capital.
IIIT-Delhi has been recognized by SBI and PNB for its education loan scheme. We are the first institute among IIITs to get this privilege. The scheme entitles a student of the Institute to an education loan of up to Rs. 20 Lakh without any collateral. The rate of interest is 0.65% above base rate (presently 9.95% p.a.). Further concession of 0.25% is available for the collateral security or work experience of 2 years.
Due to our rapid growth, the current buildings are fully utilized, with limited scope to grow further. For further growth in student and faculty strength as well as bolstering our infrastructure, construction for the phase-II of the campus will be completed between June 2017 and December 2017. This will add another 70,000 sq. meters of building space, approximately two times the current area.
With respect to placements, this year again we kept up with our previous years' strong performance with placement in top companies such as Microsoft, Xerox Research, Amazon, Adobe, and EMC. By most measures for placement
- highest domestic salary offered, the percentage of students placed, mean and median offers
- we are probably amongst the top few in our peer group.
As we all look forward to IIIT-Delhi's continued advancement and progress, we believe that we need to strengthen our academic mission of high-quality research and education, focusing on student success, and our contributions to advance our community's social development. Though many challenges remain, we are confident of addressing them in the coming years with the support of students, faculty, administration, and well-wishers.

The Institute's permanent campus in Okhla became operational in August 2012, before which it was functioning from NSIT, Dwarka. The campus is built on 25 acres of land which is located behind the phase III Okhla Industrial Estate. The Institute currently has a built up area of 32000 sq. meters including lecture halls, classrooms, research labs, instruction labs, boys' hostel, girls' hostel, dining and student center, space for student clubs, etc. It also has a general purpose playing field, tennis courts, basketball court, volleyball court, etc.
Construction of Phase II of the campus has already started. Mr. Manish Sisodia, Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi, laid the foundation stone for the second phase of the campus on 5 May 2015, Phase II will include construction of a new academic block, an auditorium, and research centers. When complete, the institute will be able to increase enrollment to 1600 and nearly half of those can be accommodated in the student residences. Currently spread over an area of 33,000sqm, the new construction will add 74,000sqm more space. The construction is likely to be complete by next year. In our campus, we continue to focus on effective resource utilization and have installed smart electricity meters which show energy usage in a dashboard. Last year, we installed solar panels of 40KW capacity, which generate about 4K units of power every month. While our cost savings are small, this helps us contribute to the environment, and also reduce our energy requirement from the grid, making it available for other uses. There are two functioning STPs through which the Institute recycles all its waste water and uses it for irrigation.
The Institute has a campus-wide computer network with a redundant 10-gigabit fiber backbone, 1 GBPS bandwidth, and a data Centre with 40 servers and 45TB storage, LAN or Wi-Fi access throughout the campus including hostels, classrooms, and residences. All classrooms are equipped with multimedia capability, including projectors and audio systems.
The Library and Information Center of the Institute has books in various disciplines and subscribes to many major Digital Libraries including ACM, Elsevier, IEEE, Springer, etc. It also subscribes to tools like Ephorus, IThenticate, Turnitin. It supports interlibrary loan and document delivery service and has many Kindle readers which students can take on loan for accessing online e-books and other e-resources.

Infosys Center for Artificial Intelligence: The inauguration was done on April 4, 2016, by Mr. Pravin Rao, Chief Operating Officer of Infosys. Center for AI aims to be the premier center in India for the development of AI. This includes both the fundamental algorithms in AI to further basic research and also the application of AI for solving societal problems specifically in the Indian context.
Cybersecurity Education and Research Centre: CERC completed two years on 23rd Jan 2016. This year one of our biggest accomplishment was to become part of the Information Security Education and Awareness (ISEA) program, Phase II. This is a Government of India initiative with about 50+ institutes involved and a total budget of close to 100 crores rupees for 5 years. Centre plans to use this project as a vehicle to make some long lasting and useful contributions to the Indian Information Security ecosystem. This year, one Ph.D. student, three Masters Students, and many undergraduates passed out from the center.
Centre for Computational Biology : The center for computational biology (CCB) has completed its first year. In this one year, the center has grown in terms of faculty strength, with 5 core faculty and 6 adjunct/ visiting faculty, and also in terms of expertise in the areas of systems biology and bioinformatics/ biostatistics. The center has established M. Tech and PhD programmes in computational biology. It is also expected that the center's research in systems biology will address fundamental questions in biology employing rigorous approaches. In addition, the center will work on biological problems that have been difficult to solve purely by bioinformatics/ biostatistics or by systems biology approaches but demand integration of bioinformatics/ biostatistics with mechanistic modeling of the underlying biology. The center, with its research strength in some of the key areas of computational biology, is well positioned to facilitate such an epigamia.

IIIT-Delhi provides a platform to facilitate interaction between students and companies, so both can find the best match as per their aspirations and requirements. We highly value our partnership with recruiters and remain committed to making the recruiting experience productive and positive for companies.
Our graduates combine rigorous thinking, hard work, and fundamentals. The institute also promotes a host of student activities to improve their soft skills, which are imperative for one to excel in his/her workspace. The result of this is evident in the institute's placement record
This year, the maximum annual compensation was Rs 32.5 lakh. The class of BTech 2016's average CTC went up from last year's Rs 9.33 lakh to Rs 11.41 lakh this year, with highest being Rs. 26.82 lakh for Indian roles and Rs. 32.5 lakh for the overseas role. Similarly, the class of M.Tech 2016's average CTC went up from Rs 8.8 lakh to Rs 10.22 lakh, the highest being Rs. 19 lakh.
The Institute received 319 offers against 222 students who registered for campus placements. Of these, 220 were Indian offers and 2 were overseas. This year we received 102 A+ offers which are almost double that of last year's 53 A+ offers. 85 companies came for final placements, out of which 38 were A+ and 47 were A. Recruiters included Google, IBM, Samsung, Accenture and many others, offering a diverse array of profiles like Software Developers, Research Engineers, Data Scientist, Design Engineer, System Engineer, Business Analyst, Frontend /Backend developers etc.
This has been a wonderful year for placements, and we have been able to place 95% students of BTech CSE and 93.33 % MTech CSE. We were able to meet the student's interest, and for the first time hosted the Big 4 consulting groups in the campus.

Internships
The summer internship program at IIIT-Delhi continues to grow every year. In addition to having our students continue working on a project/research topic, through this program we also give opportunities to students from other Institutions to work in IIIT-Delhi. This program, which is also a part of our outreach initiative, aligns with our vision to have an open campus, facilitating greater community engagement and helping strengthen our PhD intake. We continue to get support from Microsoft through their Rx program for supporting the interns. Students at IIIT-Delhi can opt for following kinds of internships: 1. Summer Internship (May-July) 2. Semester Internship 4-6 months, is not a mandatory part of the curriculum. If any BTech student proceeds for the same, it will be deemed as a semester break. MTech students need to take prior permission from their mentors for the same.

Sports enthusiasts find plenty to engage themselves at IIIT-Delhi, from intra-college events like football, table tennis, pool tournaments and the Intramural, to external events like the Delhi Half Marathon and Twaran, the inter-IIIT sports meet. The institute is equipped with a number of indoor and outdoor sports facilities.
The top floor of the Dining Block houses a gymnasium, table tennis tables, and pool tables, while chess boards and carom boards are available in the hostel common rooms. The institute currently has two tennis courts, a basketball court, a volleyball field and two badminton courts.
IIIT-Delhi has been regularly organizing various sporting events like the Intra-IIITDelhi football tournament Joga Bonito, Table Tennis, and Pool tournaments, etc. Every year IIIT-Delhi students participate in several tournaments in Delhi and outside Delhi.
This year we participated in the LSR invitational tournament, Spardha-IIT BHU Sports Fest , Twaran Sports Fest at Gwalior and achieved positions in almost every sports activity. Also, a group of students from IIITDelhi participated in Delhi Half Marathon, running for a cause.
We also organize summer camps for various sports activities at IIIT-Delhi campus. A mega sports event, Triquetra, was conceived and started from the academic year 2015-2016. Triquetra is an event jointly held by IIIT-Delhi, NSIT, and DTU. The first of this mega event Triquetra-2016 was organized by IIIT-Delhi.
On various occasions, IIIT-Delhi invited other college teams for friendly/practice matches, including those from G.B.Pant Engineering College, College of Vocational Studies, Kirorimal College, Jamia Millia Islamia etc.

There are two main student festivals - the technical festival Esya in August, which is a platform to not only showcase technical expertise but also integrate technology with social causes. ‘ESYA' which means a journey, an adventure - exploring Infinity and Beyond, is the IIIT-Delhi's TechFest, and is one of the largest events organized annually on the campus. Esya has now become one of the most vibrant tech-fests in Delhi.
The other is TEDxIIITD, which students have been organizing for the last two years. This is hugely successful, with excellent young inspirational speakers. It is expected to become a regular event in the coming years. In addition, there are cultural events like Cadence, Research Showcase, and other Tech events.
The cultural activities (arts and literary) for the year are planned together by the Student Council and the Cultural Secretary. In all, a considerable number of extra-curricular activities take place on the campus throughout the year.
Student Clubs
At IIIT-Delhi, a major chunk of students' time goes in academics as it requires hard work and focused effort. Nonetheless, there are many facilities and 18 clubs to grow in various ways. Students take part in a number of social and cultural activities. If they want to pursue a hobby, they just need to find some like-minded people to start their own club.
These clubs not only hone their leadership skills but also help instill team spirit in them. Last year; student bodies organised as many as 55 events. Several student clubs in the institute enable them to enhance their talent in areas beyond academics. Clubs already in existence at IIIT Delhi are Quiz Club - Trivialis, Design Club - Ink, Dance Club - MadToes, Music Club - Audio Bytes, Photography Club - Tasveer, the Literary Club, Eco Club and Adventure Club.
These clubs enable students to come together, share knowledge and mentor those looking to enter into the field. Students can also suggest books for the library, organize a blood donation campaign, plan for an adventure trip during summer holidays or purchase a new instrument for the music room. 250 students participated in sports activities, 50 in cultural activities, 20 in quiz contests, and 150 in technical events.
Students are also encouraged to help the society in some way or the other. Almost every student is involved with various NGOs all over the country. The institute also has its own home-grown NGO of students called ‘FindAWay', which helps the children in need.
Summary report of student clubs' activities for 2015-16, is in Appendix I.

Students are encouraged to engage constructively with the wider community and society. Community work provides students a chance to build and strengthen the broader connection with the society and the self. At IIIT-Delhi, students are required to do 70-80 hours of community work. This activity teaches students about their rights, duties, and responsibilities as citizens, and their ability to bring about meaningful change through advocacy and service. It enables students to apply their skills and knowledge to real needs in their local community. Students are encouraged to give back to society through compulsory community work credits. Students are also encouraged to learn activities like Bird Watching, Basketball, Table Tennis, Swimming, Cooking, Painting, Yoga, Aerobics, and Foreign Language for their personal growth and development
It is mandatory for every undergrad student to earn 2 credits of Community Work and 2 credits of Self-Growth by working for 70-80 hours for each.
This year our students worked on two exceptional community work projects
1. Students teach at Government Schools: Students from IIIT-Delhi volunteered to visit 5 government schools on weekends to teach the students of class 12th. This initiative drew a great response from the school students and teachers. The students were taught various subjects like Computer Science, Communications, English, Science and Mathematics. The program was extremely admired and encouraged by school teachers and principals. In view of the remarkable outcomes, we will be continuing this activity this year.
2. Summer School: The latest initiative of IIIT-Delhi delves into its philanthropic roots: Helping Hands. It originated from another social initiative: that of teaching in low-income government schools. Five broad subjects were decided: computer skills, personality development and communication skills, math and science topics, problem-solving abilities, and general knowledge. Ninety-one children registered for the summer school and the feedback is highly positive. The children were between 12 and 14 years of age and studied in class 8 and 9. The children were nominated from the few government schools where IIIT-Delhi students taught during the semester. The summer school commenced from 16 June 2016 and spanned five weeks, with five working days of four hours each week. The children enjoyed all the activities that the students had planned for them, so much so that they reached several minutes before classes were to commence. For the closing ceremony, the children prepared various performances to show their love and appreciation for this initiative. They spoke on stage about their experience of being a part of the summer school. The children who were once afraid of asking a question now confidently delivered speeches and spoke in English fearlessly. This transformation was a rewarding experience.

Appendix B1 : Technologies and tools developed and deployed
Technologies Developed/ Deployed at IIIT-Delhi in 2014-15 Developed an advanced version of the low power sensors to monitor snow petrels in collaboration with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun. The advanced version allows video surveillance of the nests. In addition the sensors deployed last year, were again used this year with great success due to their robustness and sturdiness. Currently the data is extracted and interpreted by WII.
Swarath is our entry into the autonomous car competition by Mahindra. To test the developed algorithms for driverless cars, we purchased a e-rickshaw. In collaboration with the neighboring G.B. Pant Engineering College which has a mechanical workshop, the e-rickshaw was equipped with a drive by wire system, so that a computer is able to control it. Another positive side effect is that the relationship between IIIT and G.B. Pant has been strengthened through this project.
An automated testing system for refurbished cell phones in collaboration with Overcart which is a company specialized for unboxed, but unused devices. The amount of returned items necessitated a system to test all aspects of the phone such as sensors, display, etc. Since each phone is different in design, size and functionality, the system needed to be general enough to accommodate any phone.
Developed a solution that will help DRDO to understand How, What, When, and Where of the DRDO employees are talking about and what is being talked about DRDO. Installed this at the DRDO HQ and a copy of it will be left with the CAIR Lab, the funding lab for the CARS project.
Facebook Inspector (FbI), a REST API based browser plug-in for identifying malicious Facebook posts in real time. From the release date, Aug 2015, FbI is downloaded over 2,500 times. FbI received close to 3 million requests (both public and private posts), and out of these FbI evaluated 1+ Million unique public posts.
Facebook Profile Analyser. A tool that analyses a Facebook profile to give some interesting analysis like: the different posts done by the profile (status updates, pictures, links, etc.); top 9 profiles that has liked the most number of time of the input profile; yearly / monthly / weekly / daily activities; topics and location from the place where the profiles have posted. The system is publicly available at precog.IIITDelhi.edu.in/fbanalysis
Actively involved in developing an autonomous last-mile connectivity solution with others at IIIT-Delhi. The team is also a part of the Mahindra Rise Challenge. Please note that this is far from the deployment stage.
A computational tool (combining kinetic Monte Carlo model and data analysis) is being developed that can be potentially applied to find optimal strategies in cancer therapy and for cancer subtype classification. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations elucidate biology of cancer cells at the level of single cells and thus capture cell-to-cell stochastic fluctuations. Initial efforts elucidated optimal strategies based on use of affinity variant ligands and targeting susceptible network modules. Earlier studies (cancer therapy and subtype classification), based on analysis of large-scale genomic and clinical data, have paved the way for personalized medicine. We showed how dynamical approaches, which capture single cell kinetics (such as kinetic Monte Carlo studies), provide insights into biological mechanisms (such as generation of cancer chemoresistance) and may also help integrate large-scale data for designing rigorous disease subtype classification schemes and therapeutic approaches.
Cuff-less continuous BP monitoring device prototype is presented to the funding agency ITRA and it was highly appreciated. We also have preliminary B-Plan ready and exploring the possibility of either licensing it out or a start-up.

1U2F/UAF development for the actual products of a Korean company, IRISYS. (Our U2F/UAF development
has been certified by FIDO.)
Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru 1) DRDO Tool : Developed a solution that will help DRDO to understand How, What, When, and Where
of the DRDO employees are talking about and what is being talked about DRDO. We have installed this at
the CAIR DRDO Bengaluru lab this year. Last year we installed it at the DRDO HQ. In both the installations,
scientists have used it and given good feedback. This system will have only these 2 installations
2) Bugle News: We built an RSS aggregator service called Bugle News that fetches RSS feeds from news organizations including BBC, CNN, and Reuters, and provides users with corresponding headlines. We built this system on the Freebasics platform. The news stories are organized by topic and country. Users using Bugle News would see these news snippets aggregated from different sources, categorized into eight high level topics (World News, Africa, Asia, America, Science, Sports, Movies&Entertainment and Jobs&Career). There were additional lower level topics for nine countries: South Africa, Zambia and Nigeria within Africa; Philippines, Bangladesh and Pakistan within Asia; and Colombia, Peru and Mexico within America; and two specific sports: Cricket and Football within Sports. The service was offered in English between September 17th and December 15, 2016 and has been available in English, French and Spanish since December 16, 2016. In total, we have had 100,000+ unique visitors to Bugle News until 31st March 2017. On average, we get 1,400 hits on the Bugle news everyday. Society 3) Awaaz: My Voice: An application built on the Freebasics platform which helps in getting citizens to
mark their complaints to be raised to the Government. Currently deployed in Africa. Awaaz receives 320+
active users accessing the service everyday. Society.
4) AASMA: Advanced Application for Social Media Analytics. Fully developed at IIITD. Requested by 75+
state and federal government agencies in India. Deployed in 40+ organisations. Complete system is
650,000+ lines of code and our native code is 34,000+ lines. We added 15+ installations in the period of
evaluation (1 May 2016 - 30 April 2017). Government
- Government of India has officially declared this project as STRATEGIC in nature and is closely monitoring
the growth of the same.
- AASMA has been discussed at the Secretary / Minister level, there were multiple opportunities this year
to showcase the tool to this body / level of stakeholders.
- Some agencies have also given formal feedback in writing that the tool is very useful to them and they
are using it for their internal purposes.

1. Actively involved in developing an autonomous last-mile connectivity solution with others at IIITDelhi. The team is also a part of the Mahindra Rise Challenge. Please note that this is far from the deployment stage. Dr. Shubhadip 1. A computational tool (combining kinetic Monte Carlo model and data analysis) is being developed that can be help develop precision/personalized strategies (optimal strategies) in cancer therapy and for cancer subtype classifications. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations elucidate biology of cancer cells at the level of single cells and thus capture single cell stochastic fluctuations. Earlier work elucidated mechanisms for chemo resistance generation in cancer cells (resistance generation has been a crucial barrier to developing effective cancer therapy). Current effort is focused on developing a detailed computational model for affinity variant BH3 mimetic ligands (we are not aware of any such previous efforts in India).
Dr. Tavpritesh Sethi
1. SAFE-ICU initiative at AIIMS Department of Pediatrics. Supported by the Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance. It is observed that commercial applications for warehousing medical Big-data from the ICU costs ~ INR 2 Lakh per bed, per annum. We launched our in-house developed digital-medicine framework for Intensive Care Units as the SAFE-ICU initiative (Sepsis Advanced Forecasting Engine) at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. It is an affordable & integrated warehouse of high-resolution Big-data from Pediatric ICU for a developing nation settings. The lean prototyping strategy allowed us to test the feasibility of constructing an affordable Big-data warehouse for Intensive Care Units. About 75,000 patient-hours of continuous monitoring data have been warehoused from the PICU using our pipelines developed with open-source technologies. This technology is currently being used primarily for research purposes and the commercial potential of this technology shall be explored and exploited.
